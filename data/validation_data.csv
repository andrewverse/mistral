This means you can access OpenAI' most advanced model without the $20/month price tag.

Just Ctrl+U (or Cmd+option+U on Mac) to open the page's source code. Then hit Ctrl+F, and type ""gpt4t"". If it finds that term, you have access.

I'm always shocked at how many people use ChatGPT but don't actually pay for GPT-4, so I'm now recommending every person try GPT-4T on Copilot before fully paying for ChatGPT+.

Keep in mind, even with Copilot on GPT-4T, the responses still seem to be slightly better on ChatGPT+ but this is still a huge unlock for people wanting to try the model."
