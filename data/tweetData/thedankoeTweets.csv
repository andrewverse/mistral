Repetition and conditioning.

They can experiment here and there, but their audience won't like a lot of it until they discover another piece that fits into their brand.

My point:

Test big ideas with your content until one hit.

Because it doesn't matter how many people read it if:

- It is your YouTube script
- It is published on your blog
- It can be condensed into 20+ posts

Starting with long-form writing forces you to be somewhat original.

(Which most people can't do when they are stuck in the short-form rat race.)

It forces you to actually create - to research, capture, deconstruct, experiment, and reconstruct knowledge.

It makes you take your interests seriously enough to consider your life's work.

It's as simple as deconstructing the newsletter and repurposing it everywhere in less than 10 minutes a day (once you have the process down).

Not to mention how modern work environments are the epitome of depression.

4 hours is all you need.

Why?

- 8 hours of pure focus is psychologically impossible

- 4 hours as a deadline creates a tangible deadline (narrows focus)

- completing your work in 4 hours is challenging (an ingredient of flow state)

- you are forced to do high-leverage tasks (or else you cry about how 4 hours isn't enough)

- ample rest reduces psychological fatigue (like resting from the gym) so you can produce higher quality work

- you have time to pursue the things that contribute to quality of life/work (personal development, spirituality, interest exploration

Most people's pains revolve around money, and society has evolved to reflect this in providing “security” through social conditioning and a clear path laid in front of you so you don’t have to use your gift of critical thought.

You can work the same exact position, as a freelancer or consultant, and make more money + have more freedom than if you were employed. I’m not saying that you have to stop what you are doing. I’m saying there is a better way to do it that enhances the entirety of your life. 

Psychology points to this.
Spirituality points to this.

Self-actualization demands this.
Not suppressing the problems in your life and becoming a slave to them leads to this.

And yes, just because physical slavery isn't a thing anymore doesn't mean the same essence of reality hasn't evolved to the financial and mental plane of existence.

Jobs prey on the insecurity that is baked into reality itself. Avoiding it means avoiding profound and life-changing insights.

Business is the modern vessel for contributing to humanity. Business is an act of creation. Creation is your divine gift. Creation is how you bridge the connection between yourself and God (or however you want to label feeling as if you are a part of something greater than yourself). Brahman, Teotl, The Absolute, The Universe, The All, however you want to interpret the underlying metaphysical fabric that all cultures are pointing toward. Don't let unconscious reactions cloud your judgment that stems from ideological groundless structures you subscribe and attach to out of fear of the unknown.

People that convince you that entrepreneurship isn’t for everyone don’t believe in your ability to reach certain levels of development and consciousness in your life (or they are trying to sell you something less holistic than those trying to sell you something on entrepreneurship).

Your ancestors were entrepreneurs.

They cultivated a skill set that allowed them to contribute to something larger than themselves - their community.

The Industrial Revolution caused an unsustainable development of dominance hierarchies (vs entrepreneurial actualization hierarchies) that must and will collapse.

With the internet this community continues to expand to the global level. A digital society and economy has emerged that will demand most people to contribute to it via what is now called the ""creator economy.""

Society is only as strong as the weakest link. Most jobs are low consciousness and are a major factor in limiting progress and human evolution. The person working at McDonalds isn't conscious of their responsibility and impact of making millions of people unhealthy causing a ripple effect of mindlessness and destruction. The person working for a major clothing brand isn't conscious that they exploit sweat shops in third world countries.

Can everyone immediately become the most conscious being on the planet and make 100% absolute good choices that don't cause destruction? No. Stop searching for a quick and absolute fix. Can everyone be an entrepreneur right now? No, of course not. Employment is a part of this phase of evolution and decentralization to the individual is on the horizon. Like the ocean evaporates to droplets then condenses back to rain. Jobs aren't a permanent phenomenon because they aren't in alignment with the nature of impermanence.

Jobs are also a great way to practice a skill set and relieve the stresses of money for a bit while they cultivate their value. All of this is ever-changing, subjective, and situation dependent.

Just for clarity, about 5-10% of my content was around web design. My initial tweets that gained me traction and clients were self improvement or spirituality.

Something as simple as a lead magnet is sufficient for establishing authority in a specific niche, without boxing yourself into that niche with your content.

It goes a lot deeper than “don’t niche down” or “you are the niche,” hence why I have multiple hours of content on it.

You need to be conscious of who is seeing your content and be able to position your product or service toward them.

I can talk about self improvement all day long and sell web design *if* I position that offer for them.

I.e. learning that skill for freelancing, career advancement, or building your own portfolio.

AND I can still use manual outreach methods to land done for you clients that wouldn’t resonate with that message.

And the size of my audience, regardless of me talking about web design (which I still did occasionally) would allow them to trust me more than a web design expert with 0 followers.

In content creation and personal branding, something so new, I do still believe “niche down” is outdated advice.",17,1,9,167,58251,83,0.002866904
