Here's the rundown:

-The model is training on an unprecedented volume of data, digesting billions of images to identify both common and rare cancers.

-Paige, originally a spin-off from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, already owns an AI that assists pathologists in detecting breast, colon, and prostate cancers.

-The initiative aims to boost speed and accuracy for overloaded medical staff.

-Paige emphasizes that it is a tool for doctors, not a replacement.

According to The Information— Google has given a small group access, signaling public release soon.

With Google's heavy amounts of data, can it compete with GPT-4?

Here’s everything we know so far:

1. Gemini was created from the ground up to be multimodal, meaning it process and understand text AND images.

2. Sundar Pichai CEO of Google recently noted: “While still early, we’re already seeing impressive multimodal capabilities not seen in prior models"".

3. An anonymous source involved with the product has claimed that Gemini will be able to generate text and contextual images and will be trained on YouTube video transcripts (per Android Police).

4. Gemini will be available in various sizes and capabilities, just like PaLM 2.

5. Gemini will be “combining some of the strengths of AlphaGo-type systems with the amazing language capabilities of the large models.”

Gemini’s ability to generate text and images gives it a serious advantage over GPT-4 (at the moment).

However, the defining advantage between the two is Google’s insane amounts of proprietary training data.

Google Gemini can possibly process data taken across all services, including:
-Google Search
-YouTube
-Google Books
-Google Scholar

61,"🚨 McDonald's is turning into an AI company!

The food chain just revealed they're building an AI chatbot called ‘Ask Pickles' trained on data from over 50,000 restaurants.

While McDonald’s is already using AI for ordering at 100 drive-thrus (with plans to expand), the new chatbot will provide employee guidance for worker questions — ranging from equipment cleaning to maintenance.

The details:

-Leveraging Google's gen AI tools, ‘Ask Pickles’  will train on manuals and data from McDonald's locations.

-The chatbot is part of a broader tech overhaul using Google Cloud's edge computing to enable data gathering on everything from fryers to supply chains.

-McDonald’s already uses AI for ordering at 100 drive-thrus, with plans to expand its usage.

-The massive amount of data from over 50,000 restaurants will be used to train AI models to continue optimizing systems and experiences.

My take:

I'm quite shocked (and blindsided) by the execution of McDonalds here. Not only did they flourish during the real estate boom, but it looks like they're pushing for the AI boom now, too.

And if there's one thing we know, it's that AI thrives on large amounts of data — something McDonald’s has no shortage of at its army of locations. 

With a reported over 40% of the company’s sales coming from digital channels, the fast-food giant is undoubtedly smart to double down on its tech infrastructure.",116,75,233,1495,419690,422,0.003562153

171,"Prediction: 2024 will be the year the internet changed forever.

The next AI developments are going to revolutionize every aspect of the internet.

If you truly think AI is just another hype cycle, you're in for a new awakening.

Here's what's coming:

1. Autonomous to-do lists/agents: AI that performs tasks without the need for human intervention.

These agents will be sending your emails, taking your calls, completing online purchases, and much more.

2. The advancements in Multimodality: Developers will be able to build apps that can analyze and describe images and video.

Imagine the disruption in healthcare (analyzing medical images), interactive education (learn from images), gaming (enhanced interaction), and SO much more.

We've already seen the early stages of this with GPT-4 Vision.

3. The rise of Deepfakes: Anyone will be able to clone a person's face, voice, and body with just a click.

A whole new wave of AI-generated-deepfake-disinformation is coming. This will probably become a 'mainstream' problem during the 2024 election, cause major negative sentiment to the AI industry, and further accelerate the pace of AI regulation.

4. 20x cheaper costs of development: Major advancements in AI hardware and updates to memory storage.

A current setback for the pace of AI is the high costs, but it's only getting cheaper. Cheaper costs = faster development.

5. Breakout AI-generated songs: AI-generated songs will continue to improve and become mainstream.

Grimes recently revealed software to mimic her voice, and we've already seen huge impacts with the 'ghostwriter977' AI-drake song. I think we'll see AI-generated songs hit the top of billboards in 2024.

6. AI Regulation: With the rise of these trends, there will also be a huge rise in AI regulation.

- How will AI agents ensure data privacy and security?
- How will Multimodal apps ensure accuracy and avoid biases, especially in critical sectors like healthcare?
- How can society detect and counteract deepfakes and AI-generated art?
- Will these advancements be regulated due to sociological impacts on the job economy?

Final thoughts: The future is almost impossible to predict with the multitude of factors in play, but in my opinion, the next year is when we're about to see the true AI disruption really unfold.

This is a prime example of AI being implemented for the greater good of humanity.

Here's the story:

Keith Thomas, 45, became quadriplegic after a diving accident in 2020. 

Scientists at Northwell Health’s Feinstein Institutes performed a “double neural bypass,” implanting Microchips in Thomas' brain. 

The microchips control movement and touch sensation, interfacing with AI algorithms that re-link his brain to his body and spinal cord.

When Thomas thinks about moving his arm, signals from the brain chip stimulate movement through electrode patches on his spine and muscles.

Tiny sensors on his fingers send touch information back to his brain, recreating feeling.

Within only four months of receiving the implants, Thomas has more than DOUBLED his arm strength.

The researchers also believe the bypass could promote lasting natural recovery over time.

The AI tool called CHARM has demonstrated the potential to assist doctors with aggressive brain tumors by identifying critical characteristics to guide surgery.

Key points:
-It can quickly discern the genetic profile of a glioma tumor, a process that currently takes days or weeks

-The quick identification of a tumor's genetic profile could improve patient outcomes and reduce the need for multiple surgeries

-Trained using machine learning, using images of samples collected during brain surgery

-While not as accurate as current genetic tests, CHARM can predict a tumor's profile almost instantly, potentially allowing doctors to initiate appropriate treatment faster

-Can distinguish between malignant tumor cells and benign cells and identify a tumor's grade or aggressiveness

I'm officially launching a new newsletter- The Rundown Tech.

The AI newsletter has become a primary source for over 315,000 readers to stay on the pulse of AI, and I'm incredibly grateful for all the support these past months.

But there's a small problem.

From LK-99 to longevity biotech to the Metaverse, there's a lot happening in Tech outside the AI world, that many people have no clue about.

The readers crave innovation and want more.

If you read The Rundown AI, you might've noticed the small link in the footer prompting you to subscribe to The Rundown Tech for the past 1.5 months.

Surprisingly, this link has gotten us to over 40,000 subscribers, even without a full announcement (in combination with recommendations).

If you're a part of the 40,000 who've joined and received our first edition today, I truly thank you for being an early supporter and I promise to provide immense value to your inbox.

For September, we'll keep the Tech emails to 2x a week on Tuesdays and Fridays to warm things up.

But in October, we're planning to ramp up to 5x a week, similar to the AI newsletter.

ChatGPT- Generating content ideas (hooks and titles), analyzing data through Code Interpreter, using various plugins, and proofreading my newsletter.

Claude 2- Analyzing extra-long articles that ChatGPT can't handle. For the overall chatbot experience, I also personally find Claude 2 a better chatbot to talk with than ChatGPT (feels more human).

Midjourney- Generating images and thumbnails for my newsletter.

Photoshop Generative Fill (Firefly)- Expanding thumbnails/images for my newsletter or removing text from an image.

Zapier- Whenever someone replies to one of my posts across ALL social media channels, it gets sent to my private Slack channel. This allows me (and my VA) to not have to be in multiple places at once.

Notion AI- Notion is THE place where I store all my notes (without it, my mind would explode). I use the AI-integrated feature in Notion to help me brainstorm ideas.

Notion tip: I also use Super(dot)so to create websites from Notion pages (my newsletter sponsor form and AI tool database).

Fireflies- Helps me automate my meeting notes. It transcribes and analyzes my meetings into a condensed summary for me to reference and look back to if I need it (just started using this recently).

Wondercraft AI- To turn my newsletter editions into audio versions. Recently, I’ve slowed down using this tool as I’m debating on narrating it myself.

Superhuman- Not specifically all AI, but Superhuman has accelerated my emailing experience with its automated organizing systems and new built-in AI features.

Taplio / Tweethunter- I use both apps to schedule some of my content ahead of time. My favorite feature of them is that it allows you to see the most optimal times to post (this matters for the algo).

Vimcal- Helps me schedule my meetings with AI. Recently stopped using this as much (been trying to take fewer meetings), but still very helpful when I need it.

Grammarly- Helps me with small grammar mistakes I make while writing content across both my newsletter, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Also helps me find more applicable synonyms in seconds without having to google “X synonyms”.

Feedly AI- A vital research tool for me and my business, especially when researching the latest trends for the newsletter.

Poe- The universal chatbot. Poe essentially takes all the existing chatbots and puts them into one platform for you to try out (for free!). Great to try and test chatbots before making a purchase for a subscription.

Google Docs / Google Sheets AI- Creating templates for sheets is currently my biggest use case since it really helps with the “Blank Sheet” problem. But there are plenty of more use cases I have yet to explore for this one.",52,4,40,264,104063,525,0.002536925

Still can't believe I can provide value to others' lives, work my dream job, and travel the world at the same time.

Life is incredible.

My strategy is dead simple:

1. Research Everything in AI: I spend every day exploring AI news, tools, and the best use cases.

2. Create Engaging Tutorials: Often, I find myself playing with tools for hours, making tutorials that anyone can understand.

3. Share and Educate: I share insights in a digestible format on Twitter and go more in-depth in my newsletter.

The result: Readers never miss a thing in AI, and learn the best ways to ACTUALLY integrate AI into their lives.

I say it's simple, but that's because it genuinely is.

I'm not an AI researcher or an ML engineer. I'm just a guy who's been fascinated with AI for years. 

And I enjoy sharing that fascination with others.

Since you can upload files to Claude, this is a life hack. Load a PDF of all your highest-performing tweets and use this prompt to help draft our viral tweets.

Prompt: ""Draft a tweet on [niche] in the style of [pdf file name]""

3. Email drafting

Claude drafts emails in a much more friendly and human-like way when compared to ChataGPT.

Prompt: ""I need to write a promotion letter to one of my employees. Can you draft and write an email invitation?""

4. Compare and contrast documents

Since you can upload multiple files to Claude, you can upload them both and get Claude to compare and contrast differences.

Prompt: ""Summarize the key information from both these files and then tell me the differences between both abstracts""

5. Edit writing

I personally never use AI to generate my writing. However, I DO get AI to act as a first-line editor to make sure basic grammar is done correctly.

Prompt: ""Act as an expert editor with several years of experience. Please provide a bullet point list of errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar. Provide some general thoughts on style and structure. Then, ask for any elaborations or ask me to get you to suggest further useful prompts.""

6. Summarize in one sentence

This is the easiest way to get quick, one-sentence summaries from long abstracts you don't want to read.

Prompt: ""[paste your abstract] Can you give me a one-sentence summary of this abstract?""

7. Get new content ideas

If I'm ever brain stuck on new ideas for content, this prompt helps guide some ideas.

Prompt: ""List 10 content ideas on [niche]. Keep the ideas engaging and informative. Topic = [your niche]""

8. Get multiple perspectives on an idea

Easy way to weigh the pros and cons of things while getting a second perspective. I find this prompt very helpful.

Prompt: ""Analyze [idea] and give a few different perspectives on [idea] and evaluate the pros and cons of each perspective""

This new feature will significantly enhance the shopping experience for users (I personally look at reviews, A LOT).

Here's how it works:

⇾ Tapping generative AI, the company will create handy highlights that synthesize key points from customer reviews — helping shoppers quickly gauge product sentiment.

⇾ New AI highlights give a snapshot of product features and opinions from reviews.

⇾ The feature is part of ongoing efforts to improve the utility of Amazon's 125M+ reviews from shoppers.

⇾ This new tool uses only trusted reviews from verified purchases, and Amazon will continue to police fake reviews with AI and human review.

Amazon built an empire on customer reviews, so it's smart to keep improving their utility with AI.

When I started my newsletter 4 months ago, all I had was 1,000 followers on Twitter and an unhealthy obsession for AI. 

My strategy is dead simple:

1. I spend every day researching everything happening in AI (oftentimes 12+ hour days)
2. I share everything in a digestible format on Twitter and my Beehiiv newsletter

The result: My readers never miss a thing in AI.

AI news might be trending right now, but I receive messages every day from people personally thanking me for my work, and it warms my heart every time.

The support not only keeps me going but motivates me to push harder.

I can't believe I can provide value to others' lives while working my dream job. Life is amazing.

The massive support I've received has also not only allowed me to completely bootstrap this from $0 but also allowed me to quit my job to go full-time.

After a few days of ""rest"" in the Hawaiian sun, I'm recharged and ready to provide more value than ever before.

We're only just getting started. Big things coming soon.

P.S. If you’re interested in sponsoring my newsletter- DM me! Only a limited amount of spots left for the coming month before I have to up the pricing.",132,4,53,814,568839,391,0.001430985
335,"AI has arrived at the doctor's office.

Carbon Health's new AI tool reduces a doctor’s workload by generating records and billing codes.

About 200 of Carbon Health's 600 clinicians already use it during in-person and virtual appointments.

Here's how it works:

1. The tool records and transcribes patient appointments using Amazon Transcribe Medical.
2. The transcript is combined with other information, like lab results and notes from the doctor, to generate a summary of the patient’s visit.
3. It uses GPT-4 to create instructions (based on the summary) for patient care and codes for diagnoses and billing.
4. The tool takes less than four minutes to create a medical record, significantly reducing doctors' workload.

Healthcare providers can then edit and finalize the record if needed.

From the company: ""Nearly 90% of transcripts are accepted by the provider without edits, and the records are more detailed than manual ones.""

-This shifts from Google's previous focus on improving ""language"" models to enhancing all its ""AI"" models
