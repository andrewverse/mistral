Educational second.

So, switch up your game plan.

Instead of posting long boring threads, add personality to it.

Use:
- tons of bullet points
- rethorical questions
- interesting hooks 
- storytelling
- go on tangents

Also‚Ä¶

Throughout the day, post random thoughts that show your personality. 

Don‚Äôt post with virality in mind.

Memes and rage bait are ok from time to time, but if you want a solid following that buys, use them strategically.

Post in a way the repels people you hate and attracts people who value the same things you do.

That‚Äôs how you steal attention.

And you know what?

This strategy is like a magnet at a paperclip convention.

It gets people to read your stuff.

Don't be a victim of the ¬´Empty Popularity Syndrome¬ª.

Rich > Famous.

So, listen up:

Here's how you build a following that doesn't just look at your stuff, but actually buys what you're selling:

üëÄ First, craft your vision:
‚Ä¢ Where do you see yourself in six months?
‚Ä¢ What‚Äôs your desired income?
‚Ä¢ What audience do you aim to attract?
‚Ä¢ What topics do you want to be recognized for?

üí∞ Next, create your Money Map:
‚Ä¢ Set your income goals
‚Ä¢ Decide your prices for your X audience
‚Ä¢ Plan the number of clients you aim to acquire in six months.
‚Ä¢Price accordingly

üîéThird, research the competition:
‚Ä¢ Identify 10 creators in your field
‚Ä¢ Analyze their posts
‚Ä¢ Analyze their comment section
‚Ä¢ Analyze their content types (Videos, tweets, long-form posts, images).

üìù Next, develop your content strategy:
‚Ä¢ Decide on the frequency of your posts
‚Ä¢ Decide the posting cadence (e.g., post 3x a day, 3 weekly long-forms, daily self-promotion, etc.)

üöÄFourth, start creating:
‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt skip a day
‚Ä¢ Bulk create if you don‚Äôt have much free time
‚Ä¢ Engage in the DMs and comments section

üó£Ô∏è Finally, pitch your services daily:
‚Ä¢ Post daily telling people DM ‚Äúinfo‚Äù if you need help with GOAL.
‚Ä¢ Reach out to people who engage with your posts

X is going through a transition period.

IT'S A DARK WINTER:
‚≠ï Engagement is down
‚≠ï Traffic is down
‚≠ï Ads don't work
‚≠ï Retweets don't work

But the competition will quit soon.

So keep at it.

And you will WIN.

Finally‚Ä¶

Stop focusing on vanity metrics.

Focus on the ONE metric that rules them all:

PROFIT.

I've hired many people.
""Growth at all costs,"" I said to myself.
Then‚Ä¶
No growth.
Just paying someone for being there.

It's not a good way to run a biz.

I've accepted that mistake as part of the process of learning how to manage a business. A costly mistake, that is.

Anywho,

There are many ways to buy back time.

Here are a few:

1/ Automate tasks ‚Äî shyt like assigning tasks? I use Clickup's automation. E.g.: tasks that are sent to the design stage are automatically assigned to the designer

2/ Delegate decisions ‚Äî I let my copywriter decide what's best for the campaign. He'll do magic. This has rarely backfired.

3/ Loom meetings ‚Äî Aka, no meetings. We send Loom videos, and watch at 2x speed.

3/ Raising your price ‚Äî If you charge $100/hr and go to $300/hr, you will have to work 1/3 of the time to make the same amount of money. Duh, but most people don't even see that as saving time. So I'm here to tell you about it

4/ Hire a coach ‚Äî I've got a PT. He'll tell me what to do. And instead of spending 90 minutes at the gym, I'll spend 30-45 and get better results. Same for biz.

5/ Say ""NO"" ‚Äî the word NO actually means self-love in North Elbonia. Lesson there.

6/ AI ‚Äî Text, video. We use AI to create stuff for our clients. Book covers are made with Midjourney and a bit of Photoshop. Content and email with ChatGPT and voice notes from clients. Fast and effective. 

7/ Nearly zero client meetings ‚Äî It's all mostly done through text, voice notes, and Notion.

The hardest part of buying back time is actually delegation. And what I'm about to say will ring true for many entrepreneurs because we are usually multi-talented, multi-disciplinary individuals. 

You see..

Every single atom in our body knows we can do the work.

And we can do it fast.

I know it will take us 10 minutes.

Just 10 short minutes.

So we end up doing the freaking task, knowing well we have people that can do it for us better than us.

But we know it will only be 10 minutes.

So we do it.

For the past few months, I've been perfect in the art of delegating. Yeah, it's hard. Yeah, it stresses me a lot and makes me anxious to think about delegating.

But if I avoid delegating the work, how will I buy back my time?

Hint: I won't.

So the next time you think about hiring someone or hiring an agency or a freelancer or a subcontractor‚Ä¶

204,"‚ÄúMy father used to tell me: Son, I am ugly and you are ugly, work on your personality.‚Äù

That's what Marc Anthony's dad told him once.

Here's a thread on how you can crank up your charismatic (even if you're ugly):

‚Äî

Yesterday, I saw this dumbass tweet ‚Üì

What a stupid tweet.

It reeks of insecurity.

Or worse:

It wants you to believe the nonsense so you fail in life.

You see‚Ä¶

Charisma isn‚Äôt all about your born traits.

Yes, it helps being born with a chiseled face and a nice nose.

But charisma is an art you can finesse.

Here‚Äôs your plan‚Üì

1. Learn persuasion
2. Master storytelling
3. Practice your smile
4. Take on feedback
5. Be genuinely interested
6. Maintain eye contact
7. Embrace who you are

Let's do a quick dive:

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

Step 1: Learn persuasion

Think of persuasion as your secret sauce.

Dig into books and vids on influence.

Robert Cialdini is a great start.

The gist? Understand the 'why' behind a 'yes'. Experiment with what you learn; practice on friends, or even better, apply it during your sales calls or regular zoom calls.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

Step 2: Master Storytelling

Stories can build bridges or tear down walls.

Simple stories have started wars.

So collect personal anecdotes, polish them into shiny gems, and place them strategically in conversations. It's not bragging if it's authentic and engages your listener.

If you've turned a problematic situation around or learned something the hard way ‚Äì that‚Äôs the gold stuff.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

Step 3: Practice your smile

No kidding.

Stand before a mirror and work on that grin.

Feel silly smiling at your reflection?

Doesn‚Äôt matter.

Find your best, most genuine smile, and give it a workout.

Learning to make different facial expressions (and knowing how you look while doing them) is as important as knowing how to lift to build muscles.

It‚Äôs such a shame people don‚Äôt see it like that.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

Step 4: Take on feedback

Ask for it, don‚Äôt shy away.

Grab feedback like it's your lifeline to improvement.

Actively seek it, listen without defending, and then iterate.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

Step 5: Be genuinely interested

It‚Äôs not all ‚Äúme, me, me‚Äù.

Get curious about others, and watch them light up.

Put down the phone.

Try getting others to share passions and stories.

When others feel seen and heard, they'll see you under a brighter light.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

Step 6: Maintain eye contact

There's an art to eye contact.

Nail it.

And it silently shouts confidence and respect.

It‚Äôs about balance ‚Äì too little seems dodgy, too much screams ‚Äúserial killer.‚Äù

Aim for friendly and attentive ‚Äì not laser beams.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

Step 7: Embrace who you are

Charisma isn't about a duckling morphing into a swan.

It's about the duckling rocking its waddle with pride.

Your quirks, tales, laughter, and insights are your essence.

Look at weird-ass actors like Jack Nicholson, Christopher Walken, and Woody Harrelson.

They‚Äôll charm you with their stories and quirks.

You‚Äôre unique.

And that‚Äôs your superpower.

Having a yuge social media following is great for selling courses.

But for services?

Let me tell you the dead honest truth:

A massive social media following is as good as Monopoly money if you don‚Äôt know how to turn them into red-hot leads and clients.

So forget the vanity metrics.

You only need THESE two things to cash in big time:

Killer content and a kick-butt funnel system.

Let's break it down:

‚Äî

1. Content That's Like Money In The Bank

When you craft value bombs, you've basically written your own paycheck.

You‚Äôve gotta write posts that glue eyeballs to the screen and make people slide into your DMs like ""How can I work with you?!""

The simplest way I know to do this?

Mix education with entertainment:

‚Ä¢ Drop wisdom wrapped in stories.
‚Ä¢ Drop knowledge in case studies.
‚Ä¢ Drop know-how camouflaged in examples.

Your mission, should you accept it?

Go all-in on value-driven stories.

Do it daily.

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt know how to craft stories?‚Äù

Yes, you do, buddy.

It‚Äôs as simple as:

‚Ä¢ Highlight a problem
‚Ä¢ Show how the problems affected your life
‚Ä¢ Then talk about a big (or small) revelation you had
‚Ä¢ Proceed to reveal the steps you took to fix the problem
‚Ä¢ Share the results you achieved
‚Ä¢ (Optional) What you‚Äôre doing now and where you want to be

This works perfectly for your stories, client stories, and case studies.

‚Äî

2. The Funnel That Doesn't Feel Like A Funnel

Here‚Äôs where the magic happens.

It‚Äôs one thing to get likes and retweets‚Ä¶

Another to flip a follower into a paying client.

Cue the Invisible Funnel.

‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs like your behind-the-scenes sales machine that works 24/7.

‚Ä¢ Start with content that reels people in.

‚Ä¢ Then hit them with an irresistible soft-sell‚Äîjust screenshots and testimonials with no call to action. Like, ""Check out these epic results we got... simple, really."" 

(Drop multiple of these humble brags per week.)

‚Ä¢ Finally, when they can't help but want a piece of the action, post this simple yet effective line: ""Want the secret sauce? DM me.""

As soon as they bite, it's GO time.

Focus on their pains, dish out some free wisdom, and then‚Äîonly then‚Äîinvite them to a call.

Pounce on these tactics if you‚Äôre running a coaching, consulting, or services biz.

They‚Äôre tried, tested, and freaking transformative.

Any anyone with a humble following can make bank.

But don‚Äôt take my word for it‚Ä¶

Put it to the test and report back with your success story.

You won‚Äôt believe the increase in sales I‚Äôve been seeing.

Basically, I‚Äôve been turning my emails into blog posts and then turning them into YouTube videos. 

It‚Äôs a pretty simple process, actually. 

First, I write a valuable email with some great content. 

Then, I post that email on my blog.

Next, I whip out my screen recording software and record myself going through the blog post while showing my face.

After that, I upload the video to YouTube and add a link to it in the blog post and a link to the blog post on the video description.

This way, people who watch my video can easily find the blog post and get even more value from it.

But the magic doesn‚Äôt stop there.

I take it one step further. 

I also send out an email with the full text of the blog post, including a link to the actual post.

This way, my email subscribers get the content directly in their inboxes, and they can choose whether they want to read it online or watch the video or read the blog post.

141,"Your NEW X Content Strategy For Q1 2024:

The kind of strategy NOBODY has ever told you about‚Äîespecially the X Growth Coaches (who are mostly kids paying for retweets).

‚Äî

Month 1 - Shotgun Approach to Content Posting:

- Objective: Post a wide variety of content related to your offers

- Action Steps:
‚Ä¢ Post daily on X, as many times as you humanly can without neglecting your real-life responsibilities.
‚Ä¢ The content should include educational and value-driven posts, using 'how-to' guides and addressing common problems of the target audience.
‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt overly focus on the details or perfection in each post‚Äîthe key is consistency and volume.
‚Ä¢ Keep the long form within 100-300 words.

‚Äì Expected Outcome: Gain initial traction and engagement, identify what resonates with your audience.

‚Äî

Month 2 - Analysis and Focus:

- Objective: Review the performance of the content posted in the first month.

- Action Steps:
‚Ä¢ Analyze which types of posts received the most engagement (likes, comments, retweets).
‚Ä¢ Identify patterns and ideas in your content that resonated most with your audience.

- Expected Outcome: To refine your content strategy based on actual data and audience feedback. The idea is to understand better what your audience prefers and engages with.

‚Äî

Month 3 - Refinement and Repetition:

- Objective: Capitalize on the insights gained from the second month‚Äôs analysis.

- Action Steps:
‚Ä¢ Focus on creating and posting more of the content types that were most successful in the previous months. Same ideas‚Äîdifferent words.
‚Ä¢ Continue to post consistently but with a more targeted approach based on what has been proven to work.
‚Ä¢ Begin to experiment with slight variations or advanced forms of the most successful content to keep it fresh.

- Expected Outcome: Establish a more effective and targeted content strategy that reliably engages your audience and drives more consistent results.",3,0,5,26,3194,54,0.008140263

Maybe‚Ä¶

But this simple process made my client $17,000.

All he did was do these 4 things.

‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì $17,000 Strategy ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

My client @pbasilstrength made BANK with it.

He launched a digital product.

‚ÄúBut wait, Jose‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt you teach people how to sell services?‚Äù

What if I told you that my marketing services are all about selling (1) services & coaching and (2) digital products?

Having made $500K+ in digital product sales myself, I am comfortable teaching you how to sell them, too.

So here‚Äôs the process Pat followed:

1/ Create a hype campaign
2/ Do the launch week campaign
3/ Abuse testimonials
4/ Last day promotion

‚Äî

üò§¬†Step 1: Hype Campaign (2-4 weeks)

Talk daily about what you‚Äôll be launching in your stories. Keep that curiosity alive.

‚òëÔ∏é Highlight the big idea of your upcoming product
‚òëÔ∏é Frequent updates on the timeline
‚òëÔ∏é Tell people to join your newsletter to stay informed

Next up...

‚Äî

üöÄ¬†Step 2: Launch Week Campaign (Up to 7 days)

Got a newsletter?
‚Ü≥ Send 2 emails the first day:
‚òëÔ∏é Doors are open email
‚òëÔ∏é Story-based email

Got Twitter?
‚Ü≥ Post 3 tweets throughout the day:
‚òëÔ∏é One long-form, direct response post.
‚òëÔ∏é Screenshot of past clients
‚òëÔ∏é Story email (could be copy-past from newsletter)

What about Instagram?
‚Ü≥ 4 stories, 1 carousel, 1 reel.

THAT'S JUST DAY ONE.

This is not spam‚Äîit's strategic.

You hyped them up, so they buy.

‚Äî

üòÜ¬†Step 3: Abuse Testimonials

‚òëÔ∏é Reach out to buyers ASAP
‚òëÔ∏é Thank them for buying
‚òëÔ∏é And ask for first impressions

Loving their words?
‚Ü≥Screenshot and post.

Use testimonials to keep the momentum going.

‚Äî

üí∞¬†Step 4: Last Day Promotion

Let the floodgates open.

This is your last push:
‚Ä¢ Multiple Emails (3 to 5 emails)
‚Ä¢ IG story overload with ‚ÄúX hours left‚Äù
‚Ä¢ 1-2 reels + 1 carousel
‚Ä¢ Multiple tweets

Why?
‚Ü≥To bank on the urgency.

It‚Äôs the last day, after all.

Next, close the day, thanking everyone who joined.

And close enrollment.

Here's how I would do it:                                              
                                                                                                                                 
1Ô∏è‚É£¬†First, I would post 1 engaging reel daily on Instagram.

Why Instagram?

Instagram rewards hard work. 

And their app is actually made for SALES.

Instagram's DMs has a CRM feature.

And Meta Business Suite (which is free), will let you schedule and manage your DMs easily.

""But reels are hard to create, Jose.""

It'll take you 15-30 minutes to create a short one. It's just as much as writing a thread for Twitter, but the reel never dies because Instagram has a nice little habit of showing your stuff to new people, even after months of posting them.

Anywho‚Ä¶

Each reel would be designed to generate leads for my business.

Wondering how?

I'll explain shortly.

‚Äî

2Ô∏è‚É£¬†Next, I would use the EARS strategy to interact with everyone who engages with my content.

EARS stands for: 
‚Ä¢ Engage 
‚Ä¢ Affirm 
‚Ä¢ Reject/Raise
‚Ä¢ Sell

(Engage) Start conversations with followers in the DMs.

(Affirm) I would then acknowledge their challenges.

(Reject or Raise) Depending on their needs, I would schedule a call, suggest someone else, or politely decline.

(Sell) In the calls, I would pitch my product or service.

‚Äî

3Ô∏è‚É£¬†Now, about generating leads:

This is where the $45 comes into play.

I would invest in ManyChat to automate direct messages (DMs).

ManyChat allows you to send a direct message (DM) to followers who comment on your reels with certain words. And you give them access to a free product if they comment. The only requirement is that they provide their email, which you will use for future marketing purposes.

That way you can send emails to your lead, prompting them to book a sales call with you.

Bear in mind that this free product must be related to what you‚Äôre selling.

ManyChat will cost you $15/mo.

And if you do this for 3 months, you'll spend $45 on ManyChat and close 4 clients who pay you $2,500/mo.

$10K Achieved.

‚Äî

""But can I use this strategy on Twitter?""

Yes.

Instead of ManyChat, you'd use HypeFury ($45/mo) to automate parts of your Twitter DMs.

No CRM, though‚Äîthere aren't many cheap CRM alternatives for Twitter because Elon charges $42,000/mo for developers to use Twitter's features in their apps.

Finally, instead of posting reels, you'd be posting 3-5 daily tweets, 3 threads/week, commenting on 30 posts in your network, and DMing 30 people daily (which is something you don't have to do on Instagram).",5,0,2,32,3940,37,0.008121827

I helped my client @JoshuaLisec sell 10 spots for his $25,000 coaching program.

Yielding $250,000 in 14 days.

Steal my method ‚§µÔ∏é

Many assume they need:
- A massive audience
- A complex launch
- Spend a lot on ads
To make good cash on X.

But that's not the case.

When we implemented our strategy, Joshua had:
- 3,000 email subscribers.
- 29,000 followers on X.

This isn't a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù audience.

But it's not massive, either.

Yet, we had a $250,000 launch.

What were we offering?
- 5 spots for a coaching program
- Each at $25,000

And was the launch complex?
No.

Here‚Äôs what we used:
üìù Application Form
üíå Two Emails (on launch day)
üê¶ 30 Tweets (across 14 days)
‚è≥ Limited Spots

Without:
- Automations
- Fancy gimmicks
- Extensive campaign

We excelled in FOUR AREAS:

1. Limit Availability

This wasn‚Äôt about fake scarcity.

It was real.

How?
There's a limited number of people that need my client's coaching.

Given the 5-month duration, we could only run the same deal a few times a year.

Miss out, and you'd have to wait.

We sold 4 spots on day one, another on day two, and the remaining 5 over the subsequent 12 days.

2. Filter Unfit Prospects

General marketing casts a wide net.

Since we desired a high appearance rate from ideal candidates, we introduced barriers to filter the unsuitable prospects on:
- The sales page
- The application form

We created friction.

And made it clear this wasn't for everyone.

3. Clarity in Messaging

No ambiguity.

Our message was simple and direct, emphasizing the limited spots.

4. Presell Spots

We reached our limit of 5 spots by day two.

FOMO helped a lot.

But‚Ä¶

We secured deposits for future rounds.

And kept that momentum going.

Getting us 10 students in 14 days.

Yielding $250,000 in sales.

You see‚Ä¶

There are ways to simplify charging this amount.

üí™And it all starts with a strong personal brand. A personal brand is like a promise to your clients. It tells them what to expect from your services.

üî•Then, increase the perceived value of your service. Imagine it‚Äôs like an ‚Äúall-inclusive 5-star hotel‚Äù rather than a Holiday Inn. For instance, if you‚Äôre a web designer, offer additional services like content creation, basic SEO, and designing the site. Likewise, if you‚Äôre a fitness coach, enhance your service with weekly accountability calls, access to a fitness/diet planning app like TrueCoach, and partnering with a health professional for bloodwork analysis.

üí∞Finally, learn sales. Selling is not about convincing someone to buy. It's about understanding your clients and letting them decide the best choice for the price (YOU).

Storytelling will transform you into an undeniable must-follow.

But HOW do you master this art on Twitter?

Here's The ULTIMATE GUIDE To Twitter Storytelling.

Listen closely:

Step 1: Choose your STORY.

Something personal, relatable, or controversial.

Something that will grip the minds of those reading it.

Don't be afraid to dig deep into your experiences.

Step 2: K.I.S.S. - Keep It Simple, Stupid.

‚Üí Be crisp
‚Üí Be clear
‚Üí Be concise

Your message shouldn't get lost in a sea of verbosity.

It‚Äôs Twitter after all.

Step 3: Use 3-Act STRUCTURE to write

A/ Setup: Introduce characters & conflict.

B/ Confrontation: Deepen the struggle & tension.

C/ Resolution: Reach climax & solve the problem.

But what does that mean?

Let's break it DOWN.

A/ Setup: Attention-Grabber

This is your opening tweet.

If your opening tweet doesn't make hearts race or brows furrow, it's not strong enough.

It's your chance to lure readers in and make them HUNGRY for more.

Use questions, bold statements, or provocative language.

And end it with a cliffhanger:

Examples:
‚Ä¢ ""This happened next..."" 
‚Ä¢ ""I never thought I'd share this..."" 
‚Ä¢ ""I was on the verge of BREAKING DOWN...""

B/ Confrontation: Build-up

After grabbing their attention, it's time to BUILD UP. 
‚Üí Establish context 
‚Üí Introduce characters 
‚Üí and describe settings.

Make them FEEL like they're right there with you.
Remember not to linger too long - keep it short and sweet.

Examples:
‚Ä¢ ""As I was walking to HR, my heart raced FURIOUSLY""
‚Ä¢ ""My boss glared at me‚Ä¶ I knew I had MESSED UP""

C/ Resolution: Punchline/Reveal

Lastly, deliver the PAYOFF.

This is what they've been waiting for - don't disappoint.

‚Üí Hit them with a twist
‚Üí  a revelation
‚Üí or an emotional climax.

Ensure they'll be itching to see what comes next.

Now, you RINSE and REPEAT.

Craft the trajectory of your story one tweet at a time, following this structure.

But keep in mind:

Your tweets should feel ORGANIC.

DO NOT make each tweet a standalone.
They're pieces of a larger puzzle - ensure they fit together seamlessly.

And above all:

BE UNAPOLOGETIC.

When you've captured their hearts and minds, they'll be HOOKED on every word you write.

Now got it?

Time to lay out some practical tips:

Tip #1: EMOTIONS are key.

Tap into them; make your audience feel something - joy, anger, sadness, awe...

The more visceral the reaction, the more memorable your thread becomes.

Tip #2: Your CHARACTERS matter.

Whether it's just you, or a few other personalities in your story, focus on what will make them relatable and intriguing.

Since it's Twitter, you can't give them depth. Instead, feel free to tap into stereotypes.

Example:
‚Ä¢ The asshole boss
‚Ä¢ The nightmare client
‚Ä¢ The cheating spouse

Tip #3: Don't neglect the 3-Act STRUCTURE.

‚Ä¢ Setup: Introduce characters & conflict. 
‚Ä¢ Confrontation: Deepen the struggle & tension.
‚Ä¢ Resolution: Reach climax & solve the problem.

Adhere to this proven structure.

It never fails.

Now for some crucial do's and don'ts:

DO: 

1/ Use informal language. Be conversational.
2/ Use whitespace to create visual breaks. 
3/ Engage with comments. Be part of the conversation.

DON'T: 

1/ Overuse emojis; they can be distracting or annoying. 
2/ Drag your thread on forever; know when to END it.

Finally‚Ä¶

Implementation:

Once you've crafted your masterpiece,

POST IT!

But wait...

What about TIMING?

Post during peak hours when your audience is most ACTIVE.

How do you know when that is?

Trial & ERROR, my friend.

Keep track of engagement patterns and ADJUST accordingly.

There you have it: The ULTIMATE GUIDE to Twitter storytelling.

Now go forth and TRANSFORM yourself into a Twitter must-follow.

I helped my client @joshualisec sell 10 spots for his $25K program.

We use a simple strategy ANY coach or service provider can use.

Automations? Nah.
Complex software? Nope.
Expensive systems? Never!

We went old school.

An application form, email marketing, limited spots, and a secret tactic people rarely use.

Here it goes:

üìù¬†1: An application form.

‚Ä¢ Ask the right questions
‚Ä¢ Detail the time investment
‚Ä¢ Reveal the price in one of the questions (yes, do this)

Why reveal the price?
‚Ä¢ You‚Äôll get better leads
‚Ä¢ Applicants will know how much they‚Äôll pay‚Äîno need to be talking for 45-minutes on the phone before the ""price reveal""

Coolness?

‚Äî

üì£2: Marketing campaign

We used Twitter and Email to spread the gospel of Joshua.

Joshua had nearly 3000 email subscribers and 29,000 Twitter followers when we launched this offer.

There is no secret here.

Communicate your message clearly and frequently, and you‚Äôll see an increase in sales.

‚Äî

‚åõ¬†3: Limited spots

Why? To stir up FOMO.

The results were nothing short of phenomenal.

Since we limited the coaching to 5 people, we couldn‚Äôt break our promises.

5 people joined nearly instantly.

We secured profits.

Here‚Äôs how I made it happen:

I used a simple 4-Pillar Method:

1. Systemize
2. Plan
3. Delegate
4. Review

Here's what each pillar is about:

‚Äî

Pillar 1. Systemize

Streamline each process.

‚ÄúWhaaattt?‚Äù

List all the tiny steps you must take to go from point A to point B.

Let‚Äôs use Client Onboarding as an example.

Instead of improvising every time you get a new client, how about listing all the tasks needed to onboard a client successfully?

Nearly every process in your business can be systemized.

It‚Äôs boring work.

But it‚Äôll save hundreds of hours and a lot of headaches.

‚Äî

Pillar 2. Plan

Focus on the Bigger Picture.

‚Ä¢ Do you want sales?
‚Ä¢ Do you want growth?
‚Ä¢ What‚Äôs the focus of the month?
‚Ä¢ What steps do you need to take to reach your goals?

This is where your actual value lies: planning & making decisions.

‚Äî

Pillar 3. Delegate

Find talented freelancers.

Hire fast. Fire faster.

Test their skills with a one-off project.

Give them a tight deadline.

And pay them regardless of the outcome.

Make sure each team member has clear objectives and deadlines.

Overcommunicate like it's your job (spoiler: it is).

‚Äî 

Pillar 4. Review

Do this once a month.

‚Ä¢ Which steps can be eliminated?
‚Ä¢ What can be done better?
‚Ä¢ What can be simplified?
‚Ä¢ What didn‚Äôt work?
‚Ä¢ What worked?

Easy!

Sounds too good to be true, right?

Well, it may not sound simple.

But it actually is.

Let me break down the strategy for you‚Ä¶

The objective is clear:

Keep creating content and providing value while generating income.

But first‚Ä¶

You need to lay the groundwork.

Here's what you need to do:

1/ Keep creating valuable content
2/ Share testimonials from happy clients
3/ Build a lead generation page
4/ Promote daily (non-negotiable)
5/ Embrace your moral duty to make money

Let's dive deeper into each step:

1/ Consistent valuable content

Keep creating and sharing insightful content relevant to your audience.

This could be through:

‚Ä¢ LinkedIn posts
‚Ä¢ Emails
‚Ä¢ Videos

Now, you need to showcase your competence through testimonials.

2/ Client Testimonials

Post any testimonials you have stored somewhere.

Or ask your past clients for them by having them answer two simple questions:

‚Ä¢ What results have you achieved since we worked together?

‚Ä¢ Would you recommend my services to other people? If so, why?

But there's more:

3. Lead Generation Page

Create a lead generation page using Calendly and/or a newsletter.

Calendly allows people to book calls with you, while the newsletter helps nurture connections and pushes them towards booking a call.

The fourth part of the puzzle is promotion.

4. Promote Daily

It's non-negotiable.

People need to know what you offer and how it can help them. Sh

are your content, your testimonials, and your lead generation pages as much as possible.

Now comes the fifth and final piece:

5. Embrace the Duty to Make Money

It's your moral responsibility to make money because it enables you to provide a better lifestyle for yourself and your family, leave a lasting legacy, and help more people.

""Jose, I read the tweet and said to myself, 'Yeah... why wait until 2024?' So I booked the call.""

*Cue laughter on both sides*

Then, he told me he had been procrastinating, and the tweet just got him to book the call.

1Ô∏è‚É£ First off, think about a problem your audience could be struggling with. 

‚Ä¢ What‚Äôs something they need help with?
‚Ä¢ Will they pay for getting rid of it?
‚Ä¢ Is it urgent?

2Ô∏è‚É£ Next, grab your computer and open up a Google presentation.

ONE idea per slide.

Look:

Don't let limiting beliefs screw you up.

Take these steps to make $1000 with your Instagram account this weekend.

And don't let the simplicity fool you.

It's the exact process I follow in my account and my clients.

‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢

FIRST: Pop this POST on your timeline:

""I want to help 5 people achieve GOAL. DM me KEYWORD if you're in.""

Just replace the word GOAL with the proper one.

Then, pick a KEYWORD that makes sense for your audience and the goal.

‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢

NEXT, when people show interest, hit them back with:

===
Hi NAME, ready to achieve GOAL?
Here's how:

1. We'll have two 45-minute calls
2. The first call is for mapping out a plan together
3. Second for progress check in two weeks.
Investment: $200.
Once the spots are gone, the price goes up to $300.

Interested?

Let me know so I can send you the payment link.
===

‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢

Got it?

FINALLY‚Ä¶

After you make your first sale, tell your followers there are only ""4 spots left."" 

And keep counting down until you sell out.

PRO TIP: You set the price. I go with $597 for 90 minutes. You might like $100, $200, or, hey, $500.

Pick a price.

DO IT NOW.

Best thing?

At the end of the call, feel free to sell them your other services.

1/ The Welcome Email

Why: Make a memorable first impression.

Content: Introduce yourself with a brief overview of what they can expect from your future emails

---

2/ The Authority Builder

Why: Establish credibility and trust.

Content: Share your credentials, client testimonials, success stories, or a brief case study showing results.

---

3/ The Value Bomb

Why: Offer upfront value without a sales pitch.

Content: Share a free piece of advice, a quick win, or a teaser lesson from your course. Show them what you've got.

---

4/ The Storyteller

Why: Connect on a personal level.

Content: Share your journey of how you got into coaching/services or why you developed your course. People buy from people, not brands.

---

5/ The Social Proof

Why: Reinforce trust and authority.

Content: Share more testimonials, user reviews, or positive client feedback. Show them others have benefited from your expertise.

---

6/ The Soft Pitch

Why: Introduce them to your offering without being too salesy. Just a PS at the end of the email.

Content: Highlight the benefits of your coaching or course, mentioning a few key modules or features, but keep it light.

---

7/ The FAQ Email:

Why: Address any objections or hurdles.

Content: Answer common questions about your course or coaching process, payment plans, and expected outcomes.

---

8/ The Urgency Email:

Why: Create a sense of urgency.

Content: Mention any limited-time offers, bonus content for early birds, or limited slots in your coaching schedule.

---

9/ The Final Call

Why: To nudge again to buy

Content: Tell them they've got a few hours to purchase, or they'll miss out on the bonuses. Provide a clear CTA that sends people directly to the checkout page. Get that sale.

Only memes, porn, and politics matter over there.
Posting value?

It works.

But not as well as before

You can't expect growth to be a single-topic account anymore. The richer ain't in the niches on X.

Also‚Ä¶

Posting daily and getting retweets won‚Äôt help you grow as fast as before.

What gets growth right now is replying to every comment and posts you see on this app.

This means you have to treat X like a full-time job, engaging every day like a caffeinated raccoon.

This is especially true if you have a small account.

‚Äî

So what can one do?

Many of my clients only have an X account.

My clients @JoshuaLisec and @TheeJoelLopez  get most of their clients from X.

I, too, get tons of clients over there.

So this platform still works to get clients and sales, obviously.

But what I'm trying to say is that we must change our X strategy.

Personally, I will use it to brainstorm and share thoughts throughout the day, which seems to be the most effective approach.

My reasoning is simple:

Imagine spending an hour crafting a post only to receive no engagement.

It's demoralizing.

So I'll just brain dump my thoughts here.

That seems to perform better anyway.

However, as the platform improves, gains more traffic, and resolves its engagement issues, new creators will emerge, and I‚Äôll be there to capitalize on it.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not giving up on X.

‚Äî

Not everything is bad on X.

Two things are unbeatable on X:

1. The Community
2. The quality of the content

As I'm growing my Instagram account, I can tell you that IG is great and I‚Äôve made friends over there.

However, the way Twitter/X works encourages community building and engaging in the comments.

This builds a sense of community you just don‚Äôt get on Instagram.

I‚Äôve often stopped myself from replying with foolish comments to my friends on X. The sense of community makes you feel safe in a strange way. So, you must refrain from engaging as if it were a private direct message on WhatsApp or Messages.

Also, the content on X is more valuable, refined, and practical than anything you‚Äôll find on Instagram.

‚Äî

So what‚Äôs next for me?

Right now, I am working on improving my Reels To Clients course, which is almost 100% ready. The last time I launched it, over 100 people got it. And I used their feedback to improve its content.

What sets it apart is that I am not a growth or monetization coach, and I do not make money by selling ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù schemes.

The strategies and tactics I share in Reels to Clients have helped me generate over one million dollars for my clients and over $300K for my agency this year, not including my course sales.
I‚Äôm particularly excited about this launch because I‚Äôll implement a new pricing strategy inspired by @stephsmithio's playbook.

It looks like this:
It is impressive how this strategy operates.

It rewards early buyers, creates a sense of urgency among people, and allows the market to determine the final price.

Amazing üòç

I still haven‚Äôt set the launch prices. However, I anticipate it‚Äôll range between $30 and $40. Additionally, the price will increase by $10-$20 for every 20 purchases.

Insight 1: The Power of Upfront Value

Application: Whatever you sell or offer, make it a teaser of your best self. It‚Äôs a gateway to bigger transactions.

Insight 2: Human Connection

His proactive messaging showed he cared.

The direct approach made it personal, building trust.

Application: Your online business isn‚Äôt about algorithms. It‚Äôs about human connection. Engage directly.

---

Insight 3: People Buy ‚ÄòYou‚Äô

Your prospects aren‚Äôt just purchasing a service or product.

They are investing in you.

So when someone rejects your offer, they‚Äôre actually rejecting you.

I used to think it was the other way around‚Äîthat they rejected the offer.

Today?

I know for a fact that they‚Äôre rejecting me.

And I take that personally.

But not in a bad way.

Rejection is feedback.

And I use it to make my stuff better.

Application: When you hear ‚Äúno‚Äù, don‚Äôt shy away. It‚Äôs feedback. Refine your process. Make your service irresistible.

Every follower follows one of the next two journeys:

Journey 1: Content ‚Üí Newsletter ‚Üí Paid offer
Journey 2: Content ‚Üí DMs ‚Üí Paid offer

The way this works is by:

Being shameless when it comes to promoting your stuff.

-> Do it in your posts.
-> Do it in your DMs.
-> Do it your stories.

Every day, tell your followers to:

‚Üí Join your newsletter
‚Üí Download your free stuff
‚Üí DM you if they need help

Then‚Ä¶

Show them your paid offers.

You see‚Ä¶

They know that one day you‚Äôll sell them something.

In fact‚Ä¶

They are expecting it.

So you're better off by just telling them, ""Hey, I've got this, if you need it, click the link to buy it.""

But now you may be thinking that this kind of self-promotion could lead to losing followers.

The reality?

Your followers will love you even more for it.

Why?

Hardcore followers LOVE it when you offer them a solution to their problems.

So, which journey would you prefer to build?

Journey 1 or 2?

If you're selling services & coaching, build both.

If you're selling courses, build #1.

This is the way.

Getting thousands of followers.

But I recently realized I had been doing it all wrong.

And I've discovered a shortcut.

It can get you there in months, not years.

Let me break it down:                                                

My handle on Instagram is @ JoseRosadoHQ.

Over there, I mainly shared screenshots of my tweets and 'talking head' videos.

And I want to talk about the talking head videos.

Let's be honest:

Talking head videos?

They're a yawn fest.

The only way to make them entertaining is through editing.

But, ugh, editing is tough‚Ä¶

And it can cost a pretty penny.

Seriously, who'd watch a random guy chat for 45 seconds on Instagram reels when there's way cooler stuff?

That's why I have changed my strategies.

And guess what?

It has proven to work quite nicely.

Let's talk about the 7-second Reels.

They are ridiculously easy to whip up.

And I'm still kicking myself for not trying them sooner.

I've dubbed them ""Microvawe Reels"" because, quite frankly, that's all they are.

They hook you (like popcorn) and make you want more (like popcorn).

And here's the kicker:

They barely eat into my day.

Just 10 to 15 minutes, tops, to pop one out.

So, I did a mini-test and posted reels every day.

The result?

A huge surge in my newsletter subscribers.

In just nine days, I raked in an average of 250 daily new subscribers‚Äîall thanks to those reels.

Also‚Ä¶

For the past 5 months, I've been bleeding followers.

My talking head videos are scaring my followers away.

And my carousels haven't gone viral in over a year.

So, the Microwave Reels saved my account.

And now I've realized that‚Ä¶

No other platform, be it X, LinkedIn, or YouTube, comes close to this kind of results.

Microwave reels are super quick to edit, and most of the time, I‚Äôm using content I‚Äôve previously posted.

Old tweets, emails, posts‚Äîyou get the drill‚Äîall trimmed as the video caption.

Why am I sharing this with you?
'Cause I've got a fresh YouTube video where I lay it all out.

But first...

I showed my new strategy to a guy making $100K/mo and here's what he had to say:
So here's your NEW guaranteed Instagram growth hack:

‚Äî

üéûÔ∏è 1. Train the algorithm
How? Post daily reels for 3 solid weeks.

But not just any reels.

Choose a single topic and stick to it. That's how you make the algorithm your best friend.

Next up‚Ä¶

‚Äî

üî• 2. Make the reels 5‚Äì10 seconds long.
I mean, you've gotta keep those reels short so you don't go crazy making them.

These reels are meant to hypnotize eyeballs and make people scramble to read your caption.

And in the captions is where you'll be dishing out the real juicy value.

‚Äî

üöÄ¬†3. Finally, this isn't just hot air‚ÄîI did this and saw my followers leap by over 23K.
I gained 23,576 followers in just 60 days. 

But, something really stood out to me: 

I've been losing some followers, too.

For a long time, I shared carousels and text-based images on Instagram. Therefore, my followers were mainly readers, not there for videos or family photos.

Picture this: 

I've been posting text for two years, and then suddenly, surprise! Here's my delectable Latino face.

No bueno.

Switching to video content was a big change, and I guess some folks just weren't into it.

And many people have asked me for more text-based content‚Äîsomething I'll be doing soon.

Now, people discover me through my videos.

And yes, I know my new followers like to read, too.

You see‚Ä¶

The short reels are just to grab attention. I don't really teach much in the video itself. The real lessons are in the captions. And I get folks to read the captions by simply ending each reel with a CTA saying: ""Read captions.""

My captions are longer than most.

And I always end with a CTA to leave a comment‚Äîand yes, I've definitely seen more comments because of this.

So, even if my old followers aren't too keen on video content, I've managed to break free from the Instagram growth curse growing an audience that appreciated both video and text content.

‚Äî

To wrap up:

‚Ä¢ Post daily 7-second reels to train the algorithm.
‚Ä¢ Zero in on one topic
‚Ä¢ And the caption? That's where you deliver the value.

Good?

If you're writing long-form texts, write 5 to 10 in a row.

Yeah, I had lived on the edge of financial ruin for most of my grown-up years.

And trust me‚Ä¶

It wasn't because of wild nights out or toxic relationships.

I was never into that‚Äîit‚Äôs cringe.

No‚Ä¶

It was just some really bad money moves.

Picture this:

When money came in?

I‚Äôd burn a hole in my pocket.

You'd think you'd manage your money better when you're the main guy bringing home the bacon and have kids in nice schools.

But nah, I messed up big time.

And to make matters more painful...

I married up‚Äîa transition from a castle to a cave for my wife.

Like‚Ä¶

Imagine hauling someone you adore into a storm and watching them get soaked.

Yeah, it hurt. Deep down.

So, whether it was a couple of grand or $50,000, my M.O. was like:

‚Ä¢ Money in? Cool.
‚Ä¢ Money out? Even better.

And it is not like I went on a shopping spree either.

It‚Äôs something more sinister I discovered about myself during a coaching session.

Let me tell you about it.

Being stressed and anxious IS MY FUCKING COMFORT ZONE.

I say that unironically.

They were the reason I hustled so hard.

Getting rid of them was my life‚Äôs mission.

So when I finally got rid of them, that fire under my butt just extinguished.

I just didn‚Äôt feel alive.

Essentially destroying the key elements that drove me to take action.

Seems like my tiny lil‚Äô reptilian brain just thought that self-sabotage was the only ‚Äúlogical‚Äù solution to get my mojo back.

But I wised up.

And I learned the four pillars to avoid the money pit forever:

1. Audience: Who needs me?
2. Offer: What do they need?
3. Lead Gen: How do I make them notice me? This is where I'd slip up, but no more ignoring it.
4. Sales: Checking who‚Äôs buying, talking to folks directly.

Lose grip on these, and it's game over for me.

But wait‚Ä¶

There's a twist in the tale.

Going through this rollercoaster taught me a lot about myself and others.

Looking hard at your messes and screwups teaches you a lot about human nature.

And guess what?

When you open up about your struggles, people get it.

They've faced their own storms.

So, when they see my battle scars, they see a bit of themselves.

Because people connect to scars, as they've got them too.

It just makes me more real in their eyes.

You feel me?

And that‚Äôs my vibe now:

Showing folks the basics through my stories, guiding them through the online business plains with my content, and helping them dodge the stupid pitfalls I fell into by being transparent about my struggles.

Here's the blueprint:

1/ Find a burning problem.
2/ Create a short PDF guide that solves the problem.
3/ Promote your PDF in exchange for emails.
4/ Send out emails to this list.

It all sounds simple, right?

But it works.

A while back, my pal @SEOKeval crafted a killer PDF guide.

So, I hooked him up with my blueprint. And all he had to do was promote his PDF on Twitter and watch how it snowballed into something magnificent.

By year's end, he'd not only raked in $100,000s‚Ä¶

He'd hit a whopping $100K/mo.

Disclaimer: I'm not taking credit ‚Äì my man did the heavy lifting. I just set up his smooth PDF operation.

But now‚Ä¶

I want YOU to experience similar success.

Here's the nitty-gritty on making this work:

1/ Find a burning problem.

Short = more impactful.

So envision your absolute favorite client (seriously, do it).

Do it.

Done?

Now do this‚Ä¶

Ask yourself:

‚Ä¢ What‚Äôs the ONE problem you fixed for him?
‚Ä¢ How did fixing it change his life?

Voil√†! You've nailed down:
‚Ä¢ a problem
‚Ä¢ a solution
‚Ä¢ and the benefits of implementing your solution

Next‚Ä¶

2/ Create a short PDF

Don't go all Encyclopedia Britannica on your PDF.

Just make it short and actionable.

Why?

Because your aim is to tackle a SPECIFIC problem.

A 10-page guide is enough.

3/ Promote your PDF in exchange for emails.

Write a solid tweet talking about the guide.

Slapped a short video describing the benefits of reading your guide (optional).

1. Load Speed: Nobody waits around these days. Aim for under 2 seconds. How? Compress, minimize, and use CDNs‚ÄîI use @getnitropack in my WordPress installation.

2. Clear Call-to-Action (CTA): Make that CTA button scream, ""click me!"" Experiment. Change its place, tweak its message, but always keep it in the spotlight.

3. Responsive Design: People use all sorts of devices. Make sure your page looks good everywhere, especially on mobile. I use @elemntor for WordPress.

4. Relevant Imagery: Pictures speak. Use high-quality shots that match your content. In my marketing firm, we design everything in @figma.

5. Compelling Headline: Grab them instantly. Your headline should be like that intriguing movie trailer - short but irresistible. I talk a bit more about this (and more) here: https://t.co/wZK2UFbOJZ

6. Trust Signals: Flash those badges, logos, testimonials, reviews, certifications. People need to know you're legit, and others vouch for you. I get my testimonials with @video_ask 

7. Minimized Distractions: Keep it clean. Strip away any fluff. No irrelevant links, no ads, no navigation. Focus on what you want: the conversion.

8. Engaging Copy: Say it clear and direct. Address their needs and highlight their pains. Make every word earn its place. I show you more about my Copywriting System here: https://t.co/5Blm1hCQo8

9. Simple Forms: Keep that form short. Test it. Too long? Chop it down. Your goal? Getting info, getting the sale. Not testing visitors' patience. I use @ThriveCart to get paid, @ConvertKit to collect emails, @TallyForms for my forms.

10. Analytics and Tracking: Use tools, track behaviors, understand how they move. Adjust, optimize, and stay on top of the game. I like @PlausibleHQ for my WordPress installation.",3,0,5,12,2152,15,0.005576208

Let me tell you about a friend of mine.

This dude was paying $5,000 a month to a Twitter ghostwriter who promised him the world. 

But guess what?

In 30 days, he only gained 470 followers. 

That's more than $10+ per follower.

And the content?

Oh boy, it's atrocious.

The marketing message is targeting the wrong people‚Äîthose who can't afford my friend's services. 

It's like he's throwing money into a bonfire.

Do you know what this reminds me of?

my friend is throwing away $5k every month for this subpar service.

It's disgusting.

And that ghostwriter?

He struts around with the confidence of a lion, thinking he's the king of the world.

But here's their dirty secret:

They take your hard-earned cash and blow half of it on fake retweets. 

And guess what I found when I checked my friend's account? 

Exactly that‚Ä¶

anonymous accounts with 300k followers retweeting garbage tweets.

Despite being shared by these ""big"" accounts, the tweets didn‚Äôt get followers. 

Why?

Because they're horrible.

So, my friend (and anyone else reading this), let me make it clear: 

You can't rely on Twitter ghostwriters. 

These motherfuckers are here to take your money and throw it at dumb retweets without considering marketing, messaging, positioning, or ETHICS.

Here's what you need to do:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Find your own voice.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Learn about marketing and messaging.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Understand your target audience.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Write purpose.

Don't fall for the lure of these so-called ""ghostwriters.""

Think sliding into DMs and posting unhinged tweets is the best way to monetize X?

Every single client I've ever had‚Ä¶

Whether they were looking for coaching or using my marketing services‚Ä¶

They've all bought at least one of my courses.

When I ask why they chose me, it always comes back to the same thing.

They rave about how my course helped them.

Or how much value they got from it.

They also confess they‚Äôve been following me for months.

So they were actually craving to become clients.

Funny how not many people notice this, huh?

This got me thinking‚Äîreal value speaks volumes.

Serve up some fuego knowledge, and you've got fans.

And sprinkle in a little ‚ÄúHey, want to take this to the next level? Let‚Äôs work together!‚Äù and those fans turn into paying clients.

But let's pause for a sec.

I‚Äôve got a quick pop quiz:

What do you think is the #1, absolute, uncontested best kind of leads you can ever get?

Reflect on this.

Got your answer?

Well, Emilio and I figured it out.

The best leads?

You‚Äôre paying customers.

That‚Äôs the goldmine right there.

Think about it:

These fans have already seen your magic, they've witnessed your expertise, they trust you. And if they've parted with their cash once, they're more likely to do it again.

Now, whether they bought a short, snappy 90-minute course or a deep-dive 10-hour tutorial, the length doesn‚Äôt matter. 

Because it's all about the value you bring.

Teach them something valuable, showcase your brilliance, and you've got their attention.

Turn those eager learners into loyal clients.

Jason‚Äôs an expert in SEO, helping e-commerce stores get top spots on Google‚Äôs first page.

I said to him, ‚ÄúGrowing on social media isn‚Äôt hard; it‚Äôs just kinda boring sometimes.‚Äù

Really‚Ä¶

It sometimes feels like watching paint dry‚Ä¶ but without the hashtags.

The truth is, boredom is the social media grim reaper.

But why do they get bored?

Well, at first, there‚Äôs no financial incentive.

Think about it.

Most people slog through eight-hour days in boring jobs, but they stay for the paycheck. So, if you start earning from your social media early, the repetitive tasks won‚Äôt bother you as much.

Sure, creating content for 30 minutes each day might seem dull, but content compounds. And like like fine wine ‚Äì it gets better with time.

Picture this:

You post a reel on Instagram.

Your first one gets 500 views, the next 1,000, and your 30th gets a whopping 5,000 views.

Before you know it, you‚Äôre pulling in over 1,000 views every day.

By month‚Äôs end, that‚Äôs a massive 30,000+ views.

And if just 0.1% of those viewers buy something, boom ‚Äì you‚Äôve made 30 sales.

Now, compare that to a 9-5 job.

Your hard work there stacks up differently.

You might get an annual raise, but it usually comes with more paperwork on your desk.

Plus, bosses often shift tasks from mediocre workers to you.

I‚Äôve been there, done that, without any extra pay.

I once gave 5 years to a company, moving from graphic designer to UI designer, then to human resources, and finally to marketing director.

But a month later, poof!

I got fired when the company went bankrupt.

After half a decade of dedicated work, 5 days a week, 8+ hours a day‚Ä¶

My salary had soared from $1,000 to a staggering $2,000 a month.

Not awesome.

But with social media?

I just need one hour each day for posting and engaging.

All while I see my income soar with every post.

So here‚Äôs a challenge for you:

Put aside 30 minutes daily to create content and another 30 to engage with others.

402,"Self-fulfillment comes through productivity.

If your goals, tasks, actions, and deepest desires align, you'll be happier.

If not‚Ä¶

You'll hate everything.

Just like I did when I was a productivity junkie.

It was like an addiction.

I believed productivity was about accomplishing more things using less time and fewer resources. As a result, I spent countless hours learning how to manage my time and optimize my productivity. I went as far as monitoring my physical health with a Whoop strap.

But then I asked myself, ""Is this actually making me happy?""

Tracking every tiny detail, thinking it would make me more productive, made me miserable.

So the answer was crystal clear - no.

To my relief, I realized productivity isn't about these things.

It‚Äôs about self-fulfillment.

Nowadays, my productivity system is based on answering these two simple questions with a resounding YES every week:

1. Is my income going up?
2. Am I feeling less miserable?

If I can say 'yes' to both, I'm good.

I do this because I strongly believe that my tasks should make me more money and provide satisfaction or, at the very least, not make me miserable.

Sometimes writing new stuff is boring. But even in those times, I can overcome the dull moments. Because writing never makes me feel miserable.

For instance, I felt pleased while writing this piece because it progressed well. However, I knew that I wouldn‚Äôt feel as pleased when revising it. Because nobody enjoys looking for errors or elements that require refinement. 

Nonetheless, I continued.

It just doesn't make me miserable.

But when it comes to things that make me miserable, I go to great lengths to avoid things them.

Case in point:

- Spellchecking

So I ignore every mistake.

And delegate that task to someone else.

Can you see how this works?

Today, I‚Äôm at my happiest because I‚Äôm optimizing my life to minimize tasks that bring me misery, while also exploring ways to boost my income.

This is the way.

- Each column should have 8 rows.
- Do not add a number in front of the rows.

A Student asked me that yesterday.

My response caught her off guard.

Because it‚Äôs so obvious.

Yet most people think I‚Äôm joking when I tell them how.

Before telling her how to charge more, I went on a rant about the two types of fear.

- Real fear
- Triggered fear 

The first one is the one people actually think they are experiencing.

But real fear? That something very few of us actually ever experience.

Many of us actually think that  ‚Äúwhat if the client says no‚Äù and the feelings this provoking us is ‚Äúreal fear.‚Äù

But it‚Äôs not .

It‚Äôs actually triggered fear, which I like calling fake fear:

- Fear of being judged
- Fear of the unknown
- Fear of rejection
- Fear of the future

All of the above are fake fears.

Nothing truly bad will happen to you because of these fears. Worse case scenario: you get a no or feel a bit humiliated. But you‚Äôll get over it quickly.

But imagine, if you will, yourself alone at night being pursued by a group of thugs. That‚Äôs real fear. Because you are in real danger.

Getting a ‚Äòno‚Äô in a sales call?

lol!

There‚Äôs no danger there, hence whatever you‚Äôre feeling is ‚Äòfake fear.‚Äô

‚Äújust double your prices‚Äù

Let me ask you a question:

Did you ever go on Instagram to buy something?

Me neither.

Here's the thing:

The ""Insta"" in Instagram is short for ""Instant fun,"" not ""Instant mall.""

People treat this app as a fun virtual space, not as an online mall.

So‚Ä¶

Instead of posting long, 60-second talking-head reels, I created brief, engaging 7-second ones.

And I paired them with longer, catchy captions.

Suddenly, I wasn't just catching attention‚Ä¶

I was stealing it.

And you know what?

This strategy is like a magnet at a paperclip convention.

It's simple:

‚Ä¢ Post short reels
‚Ä¢ Couple them with a long caption
‚Ä¢ End caption telling people to join your newsletter

Your FREE products are ‚Äújam-packed‚Äù with value?

This screams insecurity.

And a lack of respect for yourself.

What ""jam-packing your free products"" means is that you nearly gave everything you‚Äôve got for nothing in return, leaving your premium stuff starved of value.

The smarter strategy?
‚Ä¢ Give people less

Free stuff is an appetizer of your system, not a full-course meal.

Its purpose is to lure people in and get them started, not secure their loyalty.

The harsh truth is:

The more generous you are with your free stuff, the fewer people will take initiative. 

Because it's simply too much for them to digest.

Why does this happen?

Firstly, few people value what they got for free.

Secondly, they get intimidated by the magnitude of the tasks ahead.

So contrary to what you might believe, 

Giving less in your free products will:
‚Ä¢ make people appreciate it more
‚Ä¢ increate the completion rate
‚Ä¢ help them take action

Take for example,
‚Ä¢ The course I give away for free in my bio.

It‚Äôs a TINY fraction of my monetization system.

Yet, 

those who've applied the strategy I show in the course...

Have successfully closed deals ranging from $1K to $5K in direct messages (on twitter and IG).

No sales calls, no emails, no hastle.

Just DMing people.

The reason this course works so well is because it‚Äôs easy to follow and it's short. And I'm also not overwhelming people with the enormity of my system.

A lot of people get it wrong.

They think that posting content will make them money.

Wrong‚Ä¶

For me, making $100,000 online seemed so far-fetched.

But I realized that it was closer than I thought.

I made my first $100K online back in 2019, while being married, having two kids, and living in a third-world country (the Dominican Republic).

This year, I'm on track to making $500K, potentially more (if my next product launch goes well).

Letting me be a stay-at-home dad (it has a nice ring to it).

And many of my students of all backgrounds reached this goal and more.

All of them applied these 5 principles:

üí•Principle 1: Write Captivating Copy
Words are powerful. Good copy grabs attention, stirs feelings, and gets people to act. Spend time mastering copywriting.

üîç Principle 2: Do Thorough Market Research
Knowing your audience is key. Dive deep into market research to discover what they want, fear, and face.

üìπ Principle 3: Produce Great Content
Content is king online. Whether reels, carousels, or captions, great content boosts your credibility.

üìß Principle 4: Unlock Email's Potential
Email's still going strong. Through email marketing, you can connect with leads, announce big news, and get clients. And the best part? You're in control, unlike with unpredictable social media algorithms.

üí≤Principle 5: Get Good at Selling
A business needs sales. Online selling isn't just about pushing items. It's addressing problems, highlighting benefits, and earning trust.

üéÅBonus Principle: Share Some Freebies
Think about the Instagram way: offer valuable stuff for free to expand your reach. Things like e-books, courses, or business-related templates can draw folks in.

A little bit of time + skill is the key.

‚Ä¢ Centralize your ideas
‚Ä¢ Plan your content
‚Ä¢ Collaborate with others

And here‚Äôs the master plan to set it up:

1/ Create your content pipeline
2/ Plan and write your content
3/ Repurpose content for multiple platforms

1. Create your ultimate content pipeline.
My content pipeline looks like this:

Idea‚ÜíCreating‚ÜíReady to publish‚ÜíCompleted

2. Plan and write your content
Pick a topic. And write as many ideas about it as you can.

Then, pick the best ones and let the drafting begin.

Finally‚Ä¶

3. Repurpose content for multiple platforms
I love writing because it‚Äôs so easy to repurpose.

And with Notion‚Ä¶

I know what has been repurposed and what not.

Sometimes, it's a lazy copy/paste job.

Other times, it needs some minor changes.

Finally‚Ä¶

Lesson 1: There‚Äôs power in a well-organized content system.

By using Notion as the backbone of my process, I conquered frustration.

I know where everything is.

And when it‚Äôll be posted.

Lesson 2: The importance of consistency

‚Ä¢ Topic 2 should be complementary to your services.
‚Ä¢ Topic 3 should focus on a hobby or something you love that you can relate to your main topic.

Then‚Ä¶

üîé¬†1. Spend a few minutes collecting content that caught your attention‚Äîthe niche doesn‚Äôt matter.

ü´¶¬†2. Next, do a quick Idea Sex session. This is where you take the content you like and make it breed with your 3 topics.

So, let's say that you saw a post with this title/hook:
‚Ü≥‚ÄúDelete these words from your writing.‚Äù

You could totally turn this into:
‚Ü≥‚ÄúNever say these words in a sales call.‚Äù

Easy.

üèÜ¬†Finally:

1. Stop creating content for it to be posted today

2. And stop replying to every single comment when you get them

You're just too busy growing your business.

Instead, do this:

1. Set aside a day to create a week‚Äôs worth of content‚Äîthat way, there‚Äôs no pressure to create every day.

2. Then, schedule your posts.

3. Finally, reply to comments in batches‚Äîe.g., login at 12 pm and 7 pm, and reply for 10 minutes.

I reached 1.1 million accounts in 30 days‚Ä¶

Leading to 1000s of new followers and 50+ new members in my community.

30 days ago, I was averaging 30K accounts reached a month.

So here's everything I'm doing to revive my account:            

It‚Äôs simple.

I created a NEW Funnel:

Daily Reel ‚Üí Freebie ‚Üí Emails ‚Üí Community

1. My reels grab attention‚Äîthey're short, ~7 seconds long.

2. My free stuff shows off my expertise and makes people think, ‚ÄúWow, this is free stuff is great‚ÄîThe paid stuff must be even better.‚Äù

2. Then, my emails lead subscribers to my offers.

3. And eventually, some of them will join my community, Hypergrowth.

What you can do with a fun, little funnel is incredible.

And it works greatly because reels have a long life span. Even when you think they‚Äôre gone, Instagram brings them back weeks later, showing them to new people. Effectively reviving the reel.

Thanks to this funnel, I‚Äôm getting 100s of new email subscribers daily.
Not only that‚Ä¶

One of my freebies is now the #2 ""best seller"" on Gumroad, according to Gumtrends. That's awesome because it's bringing in lots of new email fans.
You see‚Ä¶

I used to rely solely on Twitter for traffic.

But now?

I'm also using Instagram.

And it's working quite nicely.

So, whether you‚Äôre a creator wanting a bigger newsletter‚Ä¶

Or someone with a day job looking to grow an audience and make money‚Ä¶

Or if you want to sell your services or coaching‚Ä¶

It would be a smart move to grow on Instagram, too.

I don't think posting competency tweets or anything will do much if you have less than 50 followers

At what level on twitter should we follow your strategies?

Because I already¬†tried whatever you wrote in your free course

Results:
0 clients
Not even 100 followers

I have 44 followers. 20 are bots. 10 are inactive tweeps.

So have like 14 ppl
===

Here's the answer:

Content won't rake in the cash when you've got a small following.

DMs will.

That's why it's time to send DMs (or cold DMs if you're into feet instead of tits).

So don't hang around waiting for someone to schedule a chat with you. 

See, when your following is small, your content's job is to show off your smarts, just not in the way you might imagine. 

You've got to tweak your approach.

Here's what this looks like:

1. Post content‚Äîvideo and visual cuz you're a web guy
2. Nobody sees it because you have no following
3. You send a direct message
4. Curious clients click your face
5. They scroll down your feed
6. They book a call if they like what they see

See when you shoot over a DM, some intrigued potential clients might click on your profile picture, take a peek at your posts, and think, ""Alright, this person's got it together."" 

That's the real reason to keep posting content. 

And hey, you don't need to blast out 10 tweets daily. 

Try sharing one short video daily‚Äîit's much more effective. Use plenty of visuals, especially since you're all about showing, not just telling, right? They help people see you're GOOD.

If you're making $10,000 monthly, you're probably charging $1,000 to $2,500 for your services.

Time to aim higher.

To do this, screen your leads more carefully.

You can:
‚Ä¢ Disclose your prices upfront
‚Ä¢ Target companies that actually have money

But here‚Äôs the golden egg:

Find a NEW audience.

We're talking folks who don't blink at paying top dollar for top service.

So, do your research to:
‚Ä¢ Refine your offer
‚Ä¢ And reposition your brand.

This will draw in wealthier clients.

However, attracting richer clients is only part of the game.

You also need to:

Get better at sales.

Enhance client experience

Sales is not just about talking‚Ä¶

It's about framing.

Present your service in a way that clients can visualize success.

To excel in sales:

‚Ä¢ Learn to convey the value of your offer effectively.
‚Ä¢ Understand the needs and pain points of your target audience
‚Ä¢ Tailor your sales pitch accordingly.
‚Ä¢ And develop a deep understanding of your offerings and how they can solve the specific challenges your clients face.

Next, improve your client‚Äôs experience, starting with the onboarding process.

And for the love of all things digital, stop using email as your main client management tool.

Implement systems that scream, ""I've got my act together!‚Äù

Because fulfillment is key.

Especially on the first seven days of closing the deal.

So, exert maximum effort to impress clients and make them feel valued.

And provide access to a client area where clients can access the deliverables.

And become a full-time creator in 2024.

Follow this roadmap:                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Let's begin with days 1 and 2.

[Day 1] Decide what you want to write about
1. Pick 3 topics you want to talk about.
2. Follow 10-20 creators that post about each topic

[Day 2] Optimize your profile
‚Ä¢ Change your bio: Who you help. What you do. Call to action to join your newsletter.
‚Ä¢ Use a well-lit profile picture

[Day 1-30] Post about your expertise
‚Ä¢ Think about the top 15 questions people have about your topics.
‚Ä¢ Post 5 tweets a day.
‚Ä¢ Post 2 long-form weekly posts.
‚Ä¢ Long form should be 100-300 words long.

‚Ä¢ If you can‚Äôt think of any questions, research by:
- Seeing what other creators are posting about
- Reading people's comments on X
- Asking ChatGPT

[Day 31-60] Launch a Newsletter & Sell
‚Ä¢ What got the most attention? Double down on that.
‚Ä¢ Keep posting 5 times a day and 3 weekly long-form.
‚Ä¢ Create a free product‚Äîa template, resources list, or a short guide.
‚Ä¢ Promote that product daily to grow your newsletter‚Äîuse Gumroad for this.
‚Ä¢ Email ONCE a week. 
‚Ä¢ Start selling 60-minute consult calls at the end of every email.

[Day 61‚Äì90] Build Hype for a paid product
‚Ä¢ By now, you already know what works.
‚Ä¢ So start building a course or ebook.
‚Ä¢ Post about this every day‚Äîthese posts don't count as part of your daily 5 posts.
‚Ä¢ Meanwhile, build up a waitlist. A waitlist lets people sign up to get notified about an upcoming product, allowing them to stay updated or receive priority access. You can use Gumroad to do this.

[Day 91‚Äì120] Launch the product
‚Ä¢ You'll launch on the waitlist and on X.
‚Ä¢ People who join the waitlist will get a special discount.
‚Ä¢ Give them three days to cash in the discount.
‚Ä¢ Then, promote the product on X for 30 days. Yes, 30 days. Why 30? To get more clicks.

Now, unto some FAQ:

1. How much to charge for the product?
At least $100.

2. How much to charge for consult calls?
At least $100, too.

3. What e-commerce software can I use to sell a product?
Gumroad. It's just easy to set up. You can use something else later.

4. How do I decide on the topic of my product?
You see all of those comments and questions you get? You'll find your answer there.

5. How many posts a day should I post to promote?
2 to 3 is enough.

6. What if I don't have any product ideas?
Just sell services, then.

7. Is it necessary to promote the product for the entire 30 days?
No, but promoting your product consistently for 30 days increases visibility. Promote for at least 5 days.

8. What should I do if my product isn't selling as expected?
Listen to feedback, adjust your marketing approach, and consider revising the product based on customer needs. Most people would quit. You, on the other hand, would launch the product later on.

That's all for today.

Jose

How?

Just one 25-minute call‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶Where I used a script,

Here's the script I use to close all of my deals:
                                                                                                                                                                         
Think of a sales call as a series of stages you must beat.

Each stage leads to the next one.

Here are the stages:

Stage 1: The Handshake.
‚Ä¢ Begin with, ""Can you hear me clearly?""
‚Ä¢ Then ask, ""Do you mind if I walk you through what we‚Äôre doing today?‚Äù

Stage 2: The Power Question
‚Ä¢ Ask: ‚ÄúWhat brought you to this call and why with me?‚Äù
‚Ä¢ They will share why they believe you're the right fit.

Stage 3: Future Pacing
‚Ä¢ Find out their vision by asking, ""Where do you picture yourself in the next 3-6 months?""
‚Ä¢ It helps them imagine the potential outcomes.

Stage 4: Probe Deeper
‚Ä¢ Zero in with this question: ""What do you feel is slowing you down to reach your goals?""
‚Ä¢ Look beyond the surface.
‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt be fooled by symptoms.
‚Ä¢ For example, sometimes, not having enough leads is just a sign. The real problem might be that their content sucks.

Stage 6: Show Your Offer
‚Ä¢ Walk them through your offer's commitment.
‚Ä¢ Talk features and benefits.
‚Ä¢ Reveal price.

Stage 7: Go for the close
‚Ä¢  Assume the sale.
‚Ä¢ Ask, ""Should I send you the link to pay in full or installments?""

Stage 8: Overcome Objections
‚Ä¢ Say this to any objection:  ""That's precisely why you should."" 
‚Ä¢ Then, say your rationale for why you said that.
‚Ä¢ Finally, go for the kill by asking, ""How much longer are you willing to endure it?""
‚Ä¢ Ex: 
‚Äî I don't have enough time.
‚Äî That's precisely why you should join. Because we'll work on your systems to help you save X hours. I mean, you've been dealing with this challenge for 8 months already. How much longer are you willing to endure it?

Try this in your next sales call.

And come back to say thanks when you close the deal.

That's all for today.

See you tomorrow.

‚Ä¢ 2,300+ new email subs since Oct 23rd
‚Ä¢ 400 new followers (I had lost 8K in the last 6 months)‚Äîso I'll take the win

Let me explain what I'm doing:          
                         
I'm a stubborn MOFO.

I also have a big ego.

But I had to put all of that aside to do the one thing I've been avoiding for years:

Posting 7-Second Reels

I thought I was above it.

‚Ä¢ Too smart for it
‚Ä¢ Too skillful for it

Which was kind of dumb of me.

When it comes to marketing, you don't reinvent the wheel.

You actually get 4 wheels and go for a drive.

Which is the opposite of what I was doing by posting
‚Ä¢ 'Talking head' videos ala Hormozi
‚Ä¢ Carousels (which don't get reach outside your following)

I've realized that‚Ä¶

Creating 7-second Reels Is Art.

They have 4 components.

1. The Video
2. The Video Hook
3. The Video CTA
4. The Caption

1. THE VIDEO
You just can't use any footage you have on your phone. 

You might think you can get away with posting a video of you fly fishing.

But you won't.

The video needs to be relevant to your audience.

I tried using videos of me and my family. But my following didn't respond to that.  

Thankfully, I noticed that my audience responded to footage of:
‚Ä¢ me ""working""
‚Ä¢ my workspace
‚Ä¢ my phone

So I recorded a bunch of B-Roll yesterday.

This took me 15 minutes.

2. VIDEO HOOK
Many would call it a ""video title.""

But it's not a title.

IT MUST BE A HOOK.

You must add it to the beginning of the video itself so that you get people to watch the video.

I've been using two kinds of hooks:
‚Ä¢ Storytelling
‚Ä¢ How to

They both are working remarkably well.

But the storytelling one is the most powerful.

My most recent video got me 20,000 views in 24 hours, which had never happened.

Here's the Hook I used: ""I was broke. Making $2,000/mo. So I posted content, hoping to make just $500...""

3. VIDEO CTA
This one is simple.

After a few seconds into the video, change the text to ""Read Captions.""

This is very simple stuff with a free app like CapCut.

4. THE CAPTION
Here's where the real art comes in.

The caption has three sections:
1/ Hook
2/ Lead
3/ Body
4/ CTA

4.1 The Hook
It should be 2 to 9 words long. 

Because Instagram only shows the first line of your caption when people are doomscrolling on their Reels tab.

So you better get it right.

What's working for me is using curiosity.

Here are some examples:
‚Ä¢ This Is EXACTLY How ‚Üì
‚Ä¢ #2 is the key üëá
‚Ä¢ ‚ÜìEasy Content Hack‚Üì
‚Ä¢ Free ChatGPT Hook Writing Prompt ‚§µÔ∏é

4.2 The Lead
Since the hook doesn't actually reveal a lot‚Ä¶

That second line (the lead) should get them to read the rest of the text.

What always works is:

‚Ä¢ Going against the status quo
‚Ä¢ Storytelling

Example:

Status quo: ""NICHE get this wrong""

Storytelling: ""My wife was pregnant with my second child when I told her:"" 

4.3 The Body
This is where you provide the real value.

Keep it around 100 to 200 words long.

4.4 The CTA
Instagram is great for lead generation.

So, always end with a call to action.

Either tell people to download some kind of free resource.

Or tell them to follow you.

7-SECOND REELS ARE SIMPLE TO CREATE

One reel will take you around 20‚Äì30 minutes to produce.

And because it doesn't require a lot of editing, you'll mostly spend your time writing the caption‚Äîwhich you can later post on X (that's what I'm doing, btw)

Therefore‚Ä¶

Give the 7-sec Reel a chance.

But they never talk about the one thing that's more important than all of that.

And neglecting it is the worst mistake they can make.

Because it's the difference between life and death.

Literally.

That thing is:

Health.

So, today, I'm detailing the 11 health principles that have made my life easier, healthier, and guilt-free.

‚Äî

Principle 1: Eat your Oreos

I don't ignore my cravings.

I indulge in them.

How?

I've Crafted My Cravings.

This means that I've intentionally decided what my cravings are so that I focus on foods that are less harmful to my overall well-being.

Do I still eat Oreos, pizzas, and cornflakes?

Yes.

But please, stay away from me with your orthorexia and obsessive restrictive diets that cause more stress than fat loss.

This is how I maintain my weight, around 195 pounds, while still eating pizza.

‚Äî

Principle 2: The big replacement theory

Why drink Coca-Cola when I could just drink sparkling water?

I've replaced sodas with low-calorie options or sparkling water. As a result, you will rarely see me slurping down high-calorie mocha lattes or sodas.

So you won't see me gaining fat from sugary water.

Now... one thing is for sure:

This isn't easy at first.

This is a world of convenience and comfort-seeking.

And healthier alternatives aren't always available‚Äîespecially in the country where I live.

But, whenever possible, substitute the worst option for the least worst, until you're consuming mostly what is good for you.

‚Äî

Principle 3: Avoid work that makes you miserable

I've delegated the work that makes me feel miserable.

Things like spellchecking and scheduling stuff for clients.

I don't stress about these things anymore.

This has lifted a weight off my shoulders, giving me the mental clarity for high daily performance.

Therefore, I've got more free time (and mental bandwidth) to explore other ventures and plan with clients.

‚Äî

Principle 4: Only eat when hungry.

A practice I learned from my friend @alexfeinberg1.

Previously, I ate three to five times a day to bulk up. I learned about that in bodybuilding .com‚Äîfuck them.

This led to a weight gain of around 30 pounds, reaching 215 pounds, which was significant for my 6'2"" frame.

Despite looking good and big, I felt terrible, experiencing low energy and drowsiness every day.

Not anymore.

Hungry? Eat.

Not hungry? Don't eat or drink water.

‚Äî

Principle 5: Understand your body‚Äôs cues

I've learned that when I crave sugar, it's often my body telling me, ""Hey, bitch, eat some carbs.""

So I eat the carbs.

And since I've crafted my cravings, I can enjoy those things without feeling guilty.

By understanding and responding to my body's cues, I've found a balance between indulging in the foods I love and caring for my health.

It's an approach free from guilt that allows me to have a diverse diet while managing my weight.

‚Äî

Principle 6: Surrender to your subconscious behavior.

I realized that I needed to exercise daily to maintain consistency.

I tried the three-day-a-week approach, only to give up on it every other month.

I don't fight this anymore.

So, I work out every day, even though I'd rather do it three times.

When I say every day, it's really every day, from Monday to Sunday.

Now, on weekends, I don't lift weights.

Instead, I go out for a quick 30-minute walk.

I count this as training, too.

Because I've reframed what training means to me.

Therefore, my daily walks count as training.

That way, I still feel like I trained even if I don't go to the gym, helping me keep momentum.

‚Äî

Principle 7: Stop being weak

One day I DM'd my friend @aja_cortes, telling him that I sometimes felt a tingling sensation on the soles of my feet after leg days.

He told me,

‚ÄúYour legs are weak. Train more.‚Äù

He was right.

I don‚Äôt feel this anymore.

This is especially true as you age.

The more you wait to lift heavy shit from the ground, the more painful it‚Äôll be to stop being weak.

‚Äî

Principle 8: Family time

I admire @josiahfitness a lot for this.

He's extremely busy managing his 7-figure fitness business.

Yet, he always makes time for his family.

While I do struggle with this one, every Saturday, we visit my parents, and every Sunday, my wife's parents. Also, during the day, I spend a few moments with my kids playing with Legos or some Pokemon games they have.

I also go on weekly dates with my wife.

This time helps me to stop thinking about work.

‚Äî

Principle 9: Fuck the abs

The reality is that abs aren‚Äôt the best indicator of good health.

It mostly means you have a low body fat and a lot of discipline.

They look great.

But they‚Äôre mostly a vanity metric that works great to sell a dream.

For most of us, it‚Äôs best to focus on your:

‚Ä¢ Mood
‚Ä¢ Energy levels
‚Ä¢ Healthy skin and hair
‚Ä¢ Neutral-smelling breath
‚Ä¢ Good sleep

‚Äî

Principle 10: Good sleep

Some days, I have to force myself to go to bed.

But I've gotta put in 7 to 8 hours of sleep.

This is non-negotiable.

Especially as you age.

During my 20s, I could pull off all-nighters easily.

Now in my 30s?

Impossible.

The effects of poor sleep are instant.

‚Äî

Principle 11: Delegate thinking and willpower.

I have hired a personal trainer and a cook.

My PT comes to my home every day to train me. so I don't have to push myself to do the lifting. Because my personal trainer does the pushing for me.

‚Ä¢ I don't have to plan.
‚Ä¢ I don't have to think.
‚Ä¢ I don't have to use my willpower as much.

My personal trainer does all of that for me.

I just have to follow orders.

And my cook?

I don't have to plan meals.

I say, ""I'm hungry, please cook me a steak,"" and they prepare the food for me.

‚Äî

Bonus Principle: Learn the art of fucking off

Yes, I‚Äôm not a health expert.

Neither are you.

These are the things that work for me.

They might not work for you.

So if you disagree with anything I said, fuck off.

Touch some grass.

And keep scrolling. 

It's a better way to live life.

2112,"One tiny hack I love to get sales faster without doing sales calls:

One of my clients (Joshua Lisec) scored 3 coaching sales at $25,000 each‚Äîall through email. and another 2 over a short Zoom call.

This happened in a span of 24 hours, by the way.

But how?

There are many ways, but today I'm going to focus only on one:

Price Anchoring.

Joshua‚Äôs service costs $100,000+.

When you compare his coaching‚Äôs $25,000 price tag to his service‚Äôs cost, it makes you feel like you're stealing his money. 

His followers KNOW this.

And that is KEY.

You see...

It's high time for those who master the art of price anchoring and rake in the profits that follow.

Now, what's price anchoring?

Price anchoring is when the first price you see affects how you feel about the other prices you see later.

For example, if you see a really expensive coaching first and then a cheaper one, the cheaper one might seem like a better deal because it costs less than the expensive one.

Want more?

For example, I charge more money for my marketing services than for my coaching.

My marketing service starts at $5,000 per month¬†, plus a commission on every sale. And there's a minimum commitment of six months. That‚Äôs at least a guaranteed $30,000, plus the commissions.

When you compare that to my coaching packages that range from $5,000 to $20,000, or ¬†my consult calls for $597...

My coaching packages could feel a bit less expensive.

That said, I understand that $20,000 is not cheap.

But again‚Ä¶

Price anchoring comes to play

My premium coaching is $20,000.

But I have more affordable packages, which is what most people end up buying.

That's the power of price anchoring.",2,0,0,11,2473,6,0.004448039

TWO: Their big money-maker is their newsletter.

Let me show:

1. Create a free product ‚Äî a template, course, or ebook. Anything that provides value to your audience.

2. Upload to Gumroad ‚Äî Why Gumroad and not other more advanced email marketing software? Because it's easy to use. Personally, I've got Gumroad connected to ConvertKit. This means that my Gumroad subscribers are mirrored on my ConvertKit account. Easy!

3. Promote the free product in your timeline ‚Äî this is where most creators fail. They create something, and they never promote it. It kinda sucks that this is the case. So do yourself a favor: self-promote more often.

BONUS:
4. Automate DMs with HypeFury‚ÄîHow HypeFury works is that it allows you to send an automatic direct message to people who interact with your posts as you instruct them.

1. Identity Shifts
2. Habits

So, if you‚Äôre ready to smash 2024, read on:

Identity Shift: This isn‚Äôt about pretending to be a superhero. It‚Äôs about seeing yourself differently as a business owner. You‚Äôre no longer ‚Äútrying to make it.‚Äù You ARE the expert in your field.

Take my shift as an example:

‚Ä¢ I stopped identifying myself as a freelancer. Today, I see myself as an agency owner. I let my employees handle the deliverables, and I focus on getting clients and keeping people in check.

‚Ä¢ I also went from second-guessing to walking with confidence. No more lowering my price to appeal to a different set of clients. I price my stuff high and the price keeps going up.

Next up‚Ä¶

‚Äî

Habits: The everyday stuff, the bread and butter, keeps your life and business trending in the right direction.

It's 2024 already‚Ä¶

Phew...

So it's time to trade old habits for new ones that boost your growth.

To start‚Ä¶

Try to change your Identity.

Because without an Identity Shift, you'll never succeed.

But how do you actually trigger one?

‚Äî

An Identity Shift only happens for two reasons:

1. Traumatic events‚Äîlike losing a family member or something (or someone) triggers a strong emotion in you, like looking in the mirror and feeling disgusted because you let yourself go, or your #1 client fires you. But why wait for such a moment? Fluck no. There‚Äôs a better alternative.

2. Daily actions‚Äîaka, habits. Habits shape you. And they're the fast track to an identity shift. Because you become what you do every day.

Creating good habits is like building a success factory.

But how do you build these habits?

And, how do you choose the right ones?

You'll not only overwhelm your employees, but you could be hurting your business.

I've seen it many times:

Business owners wanting to clone themselves:

Train one employee to wear ALL the hats‚Äîlike the biz owner themselves

A recipe for disaster.

Here's my story and a valuable lesson...

I took my best copywriter and made the SAME mistake. 

I tried to turn him into me: project manager, client success manager, AND content creator. And more‚Ä¶

This experiment FAILED catastrophically. 

And here's how...

1Ô∏è‚É£ My employee got overwhelmed.

He was drowning in tasks and responsibilities. Fainting, frustrated, and stretched way too thin.

I FAILED him. 

It was my fault.

And I apologized.

We quickly went back, and he returned to copywriting.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Clients fired me.

Performance slipped. Deadlines stretched.

My clients? They noticed. And they left.

Suddenly, I had to scramble to keep my remaining clients happy.

All because I tried to make one employee wear ALL the hats.

I took a HUGE hit.

So, don't try to build a carbon copy of YOU.

It's too much for ONE employee.

They are not you.

And this doesn‚Äôt mean that you are better than that.

It just means that you‚Äôre not you.

They‚Äôre not the owner.

So you can‚Äôt burden your employees by giving them the task of doing what you do in your business.

My golden advice to you is:

One employee, ONE role. üîë

Keep it simple and focused:

‚Ä¢ Copywriter üëâ Only writes copy.
‚Ä¢ Graphic Designer üëâ Only creates graphics.
‚Ä¢ Writer üëâ Only writes.
‚Ä¢ Accountant üëâ Only does accounting.

Avoid the overwhelm. Don't expect one person to handle everything just because it's YOUR business.

Okay, let's wrap this up:

Recap:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Cloning yourself is a path to disaster.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Overwhelmed employees and lost clients will hurt your biz.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Assign each employee a specific role & responsibility. Keep it simple!

Do this, and you'll see:

Hence, you try to juggle content creation and closing sales and creating offers and doing everything yourself.

Because ""I'm the only one who can do it.""

Worst thing?

Many of you quickly invest in a $10K coaching program, thinking it's the golden ticket. But what happens is that you end up relearning what you already know.

But what if I told you you‚Äôre better served by delegating your content?

Let's break it down:

üí° You're not just buying content‚Äîyou're buying time.

Think about it:

Every minute you spend trying to craft that perfect post is a minute you're not selling or strategizing.

And let's be honest:

‚ùå Not everyone has the knack for creating content that converts.
‚ùå Not everyone enjoys staying up-to-date with every algorithm change.
‚ùå Not everyone has the patience to test what works and what doesn't.

So why not delegate?

For instance, if the pain is ""I don't know what to write about,"" the desire might be ""I wish I always knew what to write.""

(Business Example)

C - Crisis
""John is a business man. His business, which he loved, was not doing well. He was losing money and didn't know what to do.""

H - Hope
""But John didn't give up. He started learning how to run a business better. He asked for advice from smart people and made changes to his business.""

A - Achievement
""After a while, John's hard work paid off. His business started to make money again. John felt proud. He had made it through tough times.""

N - New Challenges
""But now John had new problems. His business was growing and it was hard to keep up with everything. There were more people to manage and more work to do.""

G - Growth
""So, John came up with a new plan. He created a system that made his work easier and helped him adapt to changes. This was his own solution to the problems.""

E - Empowered
""Today, John feels strong and happy. He runs his successful business and isn't afraid of problems anymore. He knows he can face anything that comes his way.""

(Fitness Example)

C - Crisis

G - Growth
""John didn't give up. He experimented, started lifting weights, and eating more protein. He created his own routine. He was persistent and worked very hard at the gym. ""

I'm a pretty anxious person.

And it‚Äôs not the 'I want things now' kind of anxiety‚Ä¶

But the kind that gives me a racing heart, a tight chest, and a dry mouth.

It's the type that stops me from working and makes me feel like everything's falling apart.

It's tough.

For instance, way back, I woke up at 2 AM, all worked up.

So I headed to my ""happy place"":

My office.

That's where I feel best.

It might seem strange to find joy there.

But that's just me.

There, I fought off the anxiety until it eased.

That episode lasted for around three hours, full of trying to calm myself down.

Breath in.

Breath out.

Nothing seemed to help.

All the while, I kept asking myself:

Why?

It was tough because there was no obvious reason for the anxiety.

I have a good life: stable finances, a loving family, and a job I love.

But anxiety runs in my family, and there's not much I can do about it.

My parents and grandparents have it too.

Anyway‚Ä¶

Right then, I chose to be thankful.

Because I consider myself free.

And anxiety is basically my biggest worry.

Kinda ironic, but I‚Äôm thankful that this is the case.

Before?

I had to battle with it while paying my debts, commuting to my 9-5, and doing things I wasn‚Äôt passionate about.

So, I‚Äôm proud of starting my personal brand because it has allowed me to set my own rules, work when I want, and do what I love: write.

This freedom has brought me 200,000 social media followers, 25K newsletter subscribers, thriving businesses, and an amazing team.

That's why I love sharing stuff online.

Posting online has been a lifesaver.

It's secured my future forever.

And in just 60 to 120 minutes a day, I get everything done for the day. 

No more commuting.
No more office politics.
No more 40-60hrs work week.

And I wholeheartedly believe that if I were still stuck where I was a few years ago, the anxiety attacks would be harsher.

I guess anxiety will always be there, seeming to be genetic.

So all I can do is act in ways that don't let it hit me too hard.

Now, I handle anxiety with good habits and writing.

And the more I write, share, and grow online, the more each word helps me build a future where anxiety is just a shadow, not a constant companion.

Back in 2019, my X/Twitter feed was filled with people flashing their earnings:

""$5K today.""
""Hit $100K this month."" 
""Closed my biggest deal today.""

Honestly, it made my blood boil.

Most of them were making more money than me, which made me envious.

---

Feeling envy was new to me.

It's like you're happy for that person, but you're also like...

""I'm smarter and more disciplined than these people. How can they make massive amounts of money online, and I can't?""

Before 2019, I had never been the kind of person who obsessively wished for what others had.

I remember eyeing my friend Aldo's PS2 when we were kids, but I never lost sleep over it.

But this?

This was different.

---

2019 was my rookie year in the online biz.

I had just left my steady job and was diving headfirst into the unknown.

My wife was expecting our second child, and every income screenshot I saw felt like a slap, a wake-up call, a reminder of the debts weighing on my shoulders.

Each random income screenshot was like a voice whispering,

""You're a failure.""

To add salt to the wound, I had tons of challenges to overcome:

‚Ä¢ The third-world mentality that prevented me from charging more for my work.

‚Ä¢The little Island mindset that messed up my desire to expand outside of my country.

‚Ä¢ The lack of resources and support. I was broke and had massive debts looming over me.

So I asked myself:

---

""How can I achieve this kind of result?""

Envy can destroy you, my friend.

But here's the thing about it:

While it can crush you, it can also light a fire under you.

For me, it did the latter.

So instead of suffering‚Ä¶

I decided to win.

No. Matter. What.

This newfound resolution helped me discover three insights about life/business:

---

Insight #1. It turns out that the online game is... math

And it's the key to never having to work a 9-5 job ever again.

The trick is to get 300 people to click your links daily, turn 5% of them into buyers, and boom!

You're on your way to freedom.

The formula is simple:

300 x 5% = Freedom.

Here's what this means.

With a daily traffic of 300 visitors and a conversion rate of 5%, you'll get 15 sales per day.

So, imagine you charge $25 for a product.

15 sales x $25 x 30 = $11,250/ month.

I had a clear target.

Best thing?

Most people could make a nice living with half of that.

And since online business is math, you can safely assume you'd only need 150 clicks a day to make a full-time income online.

---

Insight #2. Envy is rocket fuel

It's raw.

Intense.

It pushes you to move.

Or at least it did that for me.

And thankfully, I moved away from it.

But if you're anything like me...

You've got the drive‚Äîan itch to scratch.

And while envy might not be what's driving you right now...

We are in a good place, you and I.

Because I can now tell you that you've got the most challenging part covered.

You see...

Most would rather stay in their comfort zone.

Same routine.

Same job.

Same life.

But you have chosen to take the road less traveled and break free from the norm.

Doing so has opened up a world of possibilities and potential that you may not have otherwise discovered.

And the way to exploit those opportunities is a simple skill I learned.

A skill that was the biggest game-changer for me.

Which skill?, you ask.

Writing.

Not just any kind of writing, though.

Let me tell you.

---

3. Persuasive writing is a radically simple skill that will open every online door‚ÄîFAST!

Writing with persuasion is like unlocking someone's mind, understanding their dreams and fears, and helping bridge the gap between where they are and where they want to be.

With that skill, my challenges turned into stepping stones.

Because it helped me develop a compelling story around them:

‚Ä¢ My third-world mentality became a story of how I now charge premium prices.

‚Ä¢ My little Island mindset transformed into the sale of how I went global and got clients from all over the world.

‚Ä¢ The lack of resources and support became my magnum opus‚Äîthe one story that has gotten me the most followers, sales, and goodwill.

I owe my current lifestyle to persuasive writing.

And it's the skill I'm most proud of building.

Today, it serves as the foundation of my marketing firm.

And shyt...

It even helps in getting my kids to tidy up their room!

Most creators have no idea how to launch their products in a newsletter.

In my marketing firm, we've launched products in as little as 5 days.

So, we've cracked the product launch code.

Here's a simple campaign we swear by.

It's our go-to method for drafting effective emails in no time.

Before I show you the emails, here are some of the results we get using this flow:

The Profitable Email Launch Sequence:

1. Heads Up Email: ""Guess what? We're opening the cart tomorrow!"" That's what you tell your audience. Get them excited and ready.

2. Open Cart Email: Keep it short. Highlight the key features and benefits. End with a strong call-to-action (CTA) nudging them to grab the product.

3. Debunk a Myth: Tackle the main objection head-on. Show them why it's just a misconception.

4. Spot the Villain: Unearth a common enemy your reader and the product can unite against.

5. Easy Fix: Shed light on why your solution is a cakewalk.

6. It's Not You, It's Them: Assure the reader they're not to blame. Sometimes, external factors play a role.

7. Future Pace: Paint a picture of a brighter tomorrow with your product in their life.

8. Bust a Bad Solution: Call out a solution that's widely disliked. Show why yours is better.

9. Address Another Concern: Got another objection in mind? Time to squash it!

10. Tick-Tock, Last Day Email: Remind them the clock's ticking.

11. Final Call Email: This is it, the ultimate reminder. Let them know it's their last shot.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 

Here's the kicker:

This flow is versatile.

You can adapt and use it for any offer, any time you want.

The real magic lies in its flexibility.

You don‚Äôt need to follow the sequence rigidly.

‚Üí Engage in the DMs to offer solutions.

The result? Leads that are already interested in what I have to offer.

üö©‚ÄúWill I make my money back?‚Äù
üö©‚ÄùWill this work?

They aren‚Äôt serious people.

That‚Äôs why, before a sales call, I:
‚Üí Share past results and discuss timelines.
‚Üí Explain the capabilities and limitations of my services.
‚Üí Establish a mutual understanding before making any agreements.

Clients appreciate transparency.

Offer it to them.

Content creators‚Äô income is 100% dependent on the algorithm.

And as soon as the views drop, their desire to post degenerate content and stupid stunts goes up.

You don‚Äôt want that in your life.

What you want is:

CONTENT LEVERAGE.

This means creating content to attract high-quality leads, clients, and buyers.

So here‚Äôs how to pivot from an aspiring content creator to a client magnet:

‚Äî

üéØ 1: Pivot from creator to strategist.

‚Ä¢ Craft content with a purpose.
‚Ä¢ Solve specific problems.
‚Ä¢ Position yourself as an expert.
‚Ä¢ Pitch your services daily.

Why take this approach?
‚Ü≥ It attracts serious leads.
‚Ü≥ Sets you up as the go-to person in your niche.

‚Äî

‚úçÔ∏è 2: Use strategic platforms.

You don‚Äôt need to be everywhere.

Choose your platforms wisely.

In 2024? I‚Äôd post content on Instagram or LinkedIn.

There, you‚Äôll:
‚òëÔ∏é Share valuable insights.
‚òëÔ∏é Engage with your audience authentically.
‚òëÔ∏é Use calls-to-action that invite people to the DMs.

‚Äî

üîë 3: Offer value first

Why? To build trust and authority.

This could be:

‚òëÔ∏é Free guides.
‚òëÔ∏é Live workshops.
‚òëÔ∏é ‚ÄúAsk me anything‚Äù sessions.

Showcase your expertise‚Äîlet the clients come to you.

‚Äî

üåü 4: Content-to-Client Funnel (the real game-changer)

Direct your followers down a funnel instead of waiting for ad revenue or brand deals.

‚òëÔ∏é Offer a free resource in exchange for an email.
‚òëÔ∏é Nurture with more valuable content.
‚òëÔ∏é Present your paid offer to those who are now warm leads.

They aren‚Äôt chasing justice.

No, it's something more sinister.

Here's why this should matter to you and your content marketing plans‚Ä¶

---

Picture this.

You're riding your motorcycle around town, feeling free as a bird.

Suddenly, the police arrive.

They take your bike.

And leave you standing there.

Why?

--- 

In my country, there is a stereotype that bikers are generally up to no good or that they do not have proper documentation.

Whatever the reason, the law's got your bike now.

And you've got to cough up some cash to get it back.

It's a sweet deal for the police as each repossessed motorcycle means a guaranteed paycheck.

---

Every few months, you might spot a police truck overflowing with motorcycles.

Very few of these bikes belonged to lawbreakers.

The police are just trying to hit a quota.

This incentive system, intended for good, breeds its problems.

---

This is an example of the Cobra Effect in action.

It describes a situation where attempting to solve a problem only worsens it.

The term originates from a real incident that occurred during the British Raj in India.

There was a region overrun with venomous cobras.

So, the Brits...

---

They put a price on every cobra head.

But the solution backfired when locals began breeding cobras to cash in.

When the government revoked the bounty, breeders released their snakes, causing a bigger problem than before.

Now, how does this relate to content marketing?

As a marketer, creator, or influencer, you're encouraged to pump out content to beat the algorithm.

But in the race to keep up, you risk burning out and stopping altogether.

The incentive to create more ends up suffocating your creativity.

So, how can you dodge the Cobra Effect in content marketing? 

--- 

Here are five tips:

1. Sustainable Strategy: Don‚Äôt sprint for short-term gains. Build a marathon mindset. Every piece of content you post today makes money 3 months into the future.

2. Understand Incentives: If a system encourages unhealthy behavior, challenge it or bypass it.

3. Plan Ahead: Having a content calendar can help you manage your workload and avoid burnout.

4. Engage with Your Audience: Build genuine relationships with your followers instead of trying to beat the algorithm.

5. Stay Flexible: Be ready to adapt your strategy based on feedback.

In short, don't chase cobras.

Pursue real value.",4,0,1,8,2094,2,0.003820439

Here‚Äôs how . . . 

- - - - - - - -

1. Delegate research to AI

Say I want to write about a few persuasion tactics for my next posts.

I ask ChatGPT for a list, pick ones I‚Äôve personally tried, and then draw from my experiences to craft the content.

Recently, I whipped up 24 reel scripts this way‚Äîscripts I can read aloud, turn into short tweets, or turn into an email series.

And it only took me 2 hours.

Efficiency maxxing.

- - - - - - - -

2. Stream of consciousness

Most of my content is born on Twitter.

Brevity ain‚Äôt easy.

But writing tweets is a great way to distill your ideas to their most fundamental parts.

My hack to write them in bulk?

I jot down ideas about ONE topic.

As many as I can‚Ä¶

Then, about another topic.

And gain‚Ä¶

And so on.

No editing is allowed.

Done?

I tell ChatGPT to refine my first drafts.

Then, I layer my personal touch on top.

And for those saying, ‚ÄúUsing AI is cheating‚Ä¶‚Äù

Well, I agree.

It‚Äôs the ultimate cheat.

Think about it:

Would you rather hire some random person to do spellchecking, test them for a few weeks, go back and forth a gazillion times, and pay them $500‚Ä¶

Or spend $20 monthly for ChatGPT to do it quicker and cheaper?

Now, this is where I get the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre relying too much on AI‚Äù talk.

Critics fear AI will dumb down content.

But I believe it‚Äôs about leveraging tools in a smart way.

You see‚Ä¶

AI enhances what‚Äôs already there.

I‚Äôm good at my craft already.

AI just elevates it.

Ultimately‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs your experiences and stories that make content resonate.

And you‚Äôll have the final say in what gets published, whether done by AI, an assistant, or a ghostwriter.

Here‚Äôs the prompt I use to fix my stuff:

Click here https://t.co/gYKuxf4oLH to get the ChatGPT prompt

- - - - - - - -

3. Block out time

Block out a day to draft content for the week or even the month.

You could draft a few hundred tweets in ONE session if you wanted to.

Most people won‚Äôt do it.

But for those who do, they can save hours in content creation.

- - - - - - - -

4. (Bonus) Schedule it

I schedule 3-5 tweets daily and 3 Instagram carousels per week.

Then, I spontaneously post when inspiration hits.

Doing this ensures I never skip a day of posting.

It also eliminates the stress of missing a day.

Some folks might disagree with scheduling.

But they‚Äôre often those who‚Äôre already making money on social platforms.

So, if you aren‚Äôt there yet, scheduling your posts is the way to go.

This approach gives me more free time.

And how you can use it in your marketing.

First, did you know people are lazy?

And that they don‚Äôt like thinking?

Amazon knows this all too well.

So they aggressively use the Default Effect to feed on people's inactivity.

----

The Default Effect is all about this funny love we have for letting things be.

People tend to stick with the selections that are set by default.

Because change seems like too much work.

Or maybe it's just unnecessary.

That‚Äôs why Amazon sets the 'Subscribe and Save' as the default option when you‚Äôre trying to buy something.

And the way they do it is brilliant.

---

Amazon tells you to 'Subscribe & Save'.

They offer you a discount.

And you opt-in because it's the default option.

But they also let you choose the one-time purchase option.

That way, they give you the illusion of choice.

So you don‚Äôt even get mad.

===

6 ways you can use the Default Effect:

1/ Add autopay to your retainers. The client can opt out anytime, but the number who will is negligible.

2/ Use industry standards. Imagine this: you go to a website and can't find the contact page because they put the link somewhere that's not at the end of your main navigation.

3/ Opt-out choices. Make your clients turn down your stuff rather than opt-in.

4/ Suggested donations. Have you ever come across those 'pay what you want' boxes with a predefined amount highlighted? That's the Default Effect right there, encouraging people to pay THAT amount without much thought.

5/ Cookie consent. Many websites have cookie consent pop-ups. By making 'Accept all Cookies' the primary and most visible choice, they efficiently harness the Default Effect to gain user consent.

6/ Consistent posting schedule. By default, post content at a specific frequency, say every day, at a particular time when your audience is active. It encourages followers to expect and engage with your content regularly.",0,0,1,9,2539,7,0.003544703

With my strong accent, I convinced three people to pay $3,000 for a coaching program that wasn't even mine. 

Out of 6 calls, 3 signed up. 

When I shared this with my clients, they said:

""Wow, impressive."" 

But I thought, 

""why? I just sold a program for $3,000""

Why's that a big deal?

In the Dominican Republic, where I'm from, 3,000 pesos isn't a lot. 

You can't buy much food with that.

So when I think of 3,000 pesos, I just shrug.

319,"Here's the single most ignored way to write content that actually attracts high-paying clients (not poor competitors) and puts you in the top 1% of your niche all without wasting hours on research or selling your soul to clickbait.

Look:

The biggest content creation lie you've been told:
-> Pick a topic
-> Choose 3 sub-topics
-> Write content about those
-> And you'll monetize easily

It's all a lie. 

Anyone with a room-temperature IQ can do this. 

And it's a losing strategy if you want to get high-paying clients.

Why? Because most people end up writing tutorials and how-to content that attract people looking to LEARN about given topics...

Or worse‚Ä¶

They attract poor competitors looking to steal your systems.

So what can lil' ol you do to actually create Wagyu A5 levels of content that attracts the RIGHT followers and not just famished competitors?

It's all about using this strategy I'm about to tell you.

Imagine for a while you're an SEO Expert who helps ecom stores get on the first page of Google.

Let's call him Willy.

Willy uses his HIGH IQ and thinks about these 2 power questions:

1. What are actual business owners in my niche sick of?
2. What is the competition posting about (so I can create better content than them or do not talk about it at all)?

Willy whips out his Apple pen and jots a few ideas on his Samsung Galaxy tablet:

My clients are sick of:
-> low profit margins
-> expensive ads that eat up their profits
-> reducing manufacturing quality to save money

And my competition is posting:
-> How to find the best keywords
-> Step-by-step to increase your traffic with SEO
-> Backlink strategy to get traffic from Google
-> other BS that REAL store owners don't care about

Yuck ü§Æ

Here's a better way, friend.

Write about THE BENEFIT first and don't even think about talking about TECHNICAL PROBLEMS (or you'll attract competitors).

Reason being that clients don't know shyt about fluck about the technicalities of you what you do‚Äînor do they care.

Clients only care about:
-> making money 
-> spending less money
-> getting results from your services

So ask yourself:

What's in for my reader?

Because our hero SEO Expert Willy did his research, he can now create content that presses on those pains like a hot coal on their forehead.

All without focusing too much on the technical stuff.

So let's turn the PAINS into benefits.

Them clients want to go from
‚Ä¢ low profit margins -> increased profit margins
‚Ä¢ expensive ads -> cheaper traffic source
‚Ä¢ cheap products -> high-quality products people will recommend

So instead of writing:

-> Step-by-step to increase your traffic with SEO

Write:

-> Ecom Store Owners: Here's the single most ignored tool to increase your profit margins without ads that eat up your profits or sending manufacturing to a slave factory in China to save on cost (because you have morals):

Bam!

You've got a killer there.

Is it more verbose?

Yes.

Does it tackle the pains of the ecom store owner?

Yes.

Does it answer what's in for the reader?

Hell flucking yes.

He's the muscle.

I'm the chat & sales.

Last week, I had three potential deals on the line.

""Easy sale,"" I thought.

You see,

The last time I ran this same offer?

I was closing at 50%.

But this time?

Total bust. Not a single bite. Nada.

This blew my mind‚Äîin the worse way possible.

So, what the hell happened?

I know what went wrong.

But first, here's how I fixed it:

I swiped the playbook from my business coaching service.

And tweaked it to fit the fitness crowd.

I call it the 3x5 Playbook:

3 PHASES
5 PILLARS

All spread out over 3 months.

And it works for every niche.

Let's break down the Playbook:

The 3 PHASES.

These are the distinct periods of your coaching.

Usually, each phase covers about one month of coaching.

And by dividing your coaching in phases, you SIMPLIFY everything for the client.

It  shows them the big picture.

Here's how I break down the phases.

Month 1: Set habits
Month 2: Assess the habits
Month 3: Optimize and future-proof

Month one is all about getting the client to take while he's still motivated. 

Month two is where we see what's working and what's not working.

Month three is when the significant results start pouring in and when we show clients what to do after the coaching ends.

Let me give your TWO examples:

For the fitness coaching, here's what I offer:

Phase One: Make It Automatic (implying habit building)
Phase Two: Make It Efficient (Figure out what works)
Phase Three: Make It Future-proof

For my biz coaching, here's what I show:

Phase One: Create the system
Phase Two: Launch the system
Phase Three: Automate the system

Now, let's dig into...

The 5 PILLARS.

These cover the fundamentals.

They provide clarity to your clients.

For fitness and health, they could be:

‚Ä¢ Nutrition
‚Ä¢ Workouts
‚Ä¢ Time Management
‚Ä¢ Recovery
‚Ä¢ Accountability

For my biz coaching & marketing services, they are:
‚Ä¢ Content Marketing
‚Ä¢ Lead Generation
‚Ä¢ Email Marketing
‚Ä¢ Sales
‚Ä¢ Automation

Can you see how handy this 3x5 Playbook is?

Anywho...

Back to the sales bust.

Why'd it happen?

Well‚Ä¶

I asked the potential clients what was missing.

Here's the gist of what they said:

""I just didn't know how your team would help me lose weight.""

AKA:

They didn't understand the system, the process, the WHAT.

So, I had to lay it out plain and simple.

Which is exactly what I did.

During the weekend, I devised the 3x5 for the Fitness Coaching.

And it worked!

Just yesterday, I made another sale.

So, how can you use this 3x5 Playbook for your business?

Here's the magic secret formula:

‚Ä¢ Take a good hard look at your sales calls
‚Ä¢ Ask for brutal truth on what's missing
‚Ä¢ Make your own 3x5 Playbook
‚Ä¢ Test it

Right then, I knew the 9-5 life wasn‚Äôt for me.

I was done.

Angry and determined by pure spite, I started building my own brand.

And it worked.

Now, to save you from your own ‚ÄòDay Job Drama‚Äô‚Ä¶

Here‚Äôs a quick guide to kickstart your internet business this weekend.

1. Skill hunt: List down 3-5 things you‚Äôre good at. These are your moneymakers.

2. Seek the pain point: Match your skills to problems you can solve. For instance, as a web designer, I make cool websites for clients. It‚Äôs that simple.

3. Research: Find who needs your skills, their issues, and what competitors are doing.

4. Build a social media presence: Share tips and show your expertise. Tailor your posts to each platform. For example, post 5 tweets a day on Twitter or 1 reel a day on IG.

5. Jump In, Adjust Later: Start your business even if it‚Äôs not ‚Äòperfect.‚Äô Make changes as you go.

This simple formula was my life-saver, and it‚Äôs worked wonders for my students too.

It‚Äôs pretty epic getting paid for sharing what you love.

Stay winning,

‚Äì Jose, the Ex-9-5er

The true barrier preventing you from securing those high-ticket deals and creating a pipeline so robust that your calendar is bursting with potential deals...

...is down to TWO crucial decisions you've yet to make:

The first is to decide to truly commit to mastering the art of the sales call.
-> Understand your audience
-> Learn to ask deeper questions
-> Do roleplay with your internet buddies
-> Figure out the REAL triggers that make clients take action
-> Memorize how to answer every objection you‚Äôve ever faced
-> Know your offer details so well that you can change how you talk about it to match your client‚Äôs needs without changing what you offer or its features.

The second is to commit to understanding your ideal client's pain points and ONLY work with those you can truly help:
-> No more trying to close anyone with a credit card
-> Only work with people who actually need your help
-> Make the qualification process more thorough.

If you‚Äôre fully committed to your X biz‚Ä¶

This step-by-step is for you:

---

Your Roadmap:

1/ Daily Outreach
2/ Be salesy
3/ Follow up

For inspiration, let me share a success story:

Before I do...

What can you sell with this strategy?

‚Ä¢ Coaching
‚Ä¢ Services
‚Ä¢ Courses

I've sold them all.

Ranging from $500 to $5000.

Without sales calls.

BUT‚Ä¶

I highly recommend you have the sales calls.

Anywho‚Ä¶

---

Here‚Äôs the success story:

Matteo was stuck at $15K/mo for 4 months.

‚ÄúI was being too Salesy, Jose. So I stopped the outreach,‚Äù he told me.

So, I gave him a lil' push:

‚ÄúNo chats, no cash. Simple as that.‚Äù

And boy, did things turn around.

---

üöÄ Quick Result Alert:

Matteo began DMing people again.

And a few days later‚Ä¶

He saw the money roll in, fast.

Here's what he sent me:
If you wanna ride that wave‚Ä¶

Let's break it down:

---

1/ Daily outreach

It's a numbers game:

Send 50 DMs daily.

500 DMs should bag you ~10 calls.
(Yeah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the math)

Of those 10 calls, you‚Äôll close 3.
(Yes, that‚Äôs also the math)

Got it?

So, you might wonder:

What the heck do you even DM?

---

2/ Be Salesy

Here‚Äôs the deal:

You‚Äôre out to solve their problem.

So imagine you're a fitness coach like Matteo.

3/ Follow up

Almost daily.

Pay attention:

Because this is the exact approach I use to help my marketing clients SCALE.

And it works even if you have no:
‚Ä¢ marketing experience
‚Ä¢ tons of followers

Let's go!

......

Let‚Äôs set some non-negotiables:

If you're not fully committed to your business, this ain't for you.

Ok?

But if you are‚Ä¶

Here's the roadmap:

......

The Roadmap:

1/ Persistent outreach
2/ Ignore the 'Too Salesy' myth 
3/ Engage with more and more people daily.

Sounds hard, right?

It's not.

Let me show you:

......

For inspiration, let me share a success story:

My client Matteo was hesitant to do more outreach.

Last Tuesday, he told me:

‚ÄúI was being too Salesy, Jose. So I stopped the outreach.‚Äù

You see‚Ä¶

......

Matteo had been stuck at $15K/mo for around 4 months.

And no wonder‚Ä¶

No outreach = No sales

So I nudged him towards this approach.

The result?

......

He saw his efforts bear fruit quite fast.

He just sent me this message:

I want YOU to taste similar success.

Here's the detailed breakdown of making this work:

......

1/ Embrace persistent outreach.

More the people you reach, better are your chances.

Here‚Äôs the math:

100 DMs ‚Üí 2-3 sales call
10 sales call ‚Üí 3 sales

Done?

Now‚Ä¶

What do you say in this DM you‚Äôll be sending?

......

Ask yourself:

‚Ä¢ What‚Äôs the ONE problem you can solve for them?
‚Ä¢ How does solving it change their life?

Bingo!

You've pinned down:

‚Ä¢ a problem
‚Ä¢ a solution
‚Ä¢ and the benefits of implementing your solution

Now, let‚Äôs understand what‚Äôs next:

......

2/ Don‚Äôt be afraid of being ‚ÄòToo Salesy‚Äô.

Don‚Äôt hold back while explaining your solutions.

Make them valuable and desirable.

Why?

Because your goal is to address a SPECIFIC problem.

Now, let‚Äôs look at an example:

......

Imagine you‚Äôre a fitness coach.

Problem: People are fat
Solution: Online fitness coaching
Benefit: Help clients lose 20lbs in 12 weeks.

What would I send as a DM them?

Let me show you.

[Wait for answer]

Then qualify them.

And get them to book a call with you.

You see.‚Ä¶

......

The DMs are aimed at getting clients to schedule a call with you.

And the more you hone this strategy‚Ä¶

The more calls you‚Äôll get.

Eventually you‚Äôll be increasing your outreach to bring in more leads.

Why should someone hire you when you've got no proven track record of happy clients?
‚Ä¢ They shouldn't.
‚Ä¢ And they won't in most cases.

The fix?
‚Ä¢ Work for extraordinarily cheap or for free.
‚Ä¢ Or do the work for yourself first.

The way I did it?
I sold my first website to my godmother for $300-$500 bucks ONLY after I had created my website, my dad's website, and a bunch of other test websites.

Friends:

You cannot expect people to pay you $1500, or $3000, or $5000+ for your services when you're new at it.

1. Choose Your Ebook Topic

Think about what your audience needs.

Consider these 2 questions:

‚Ä¢ Who will want to read my ebook?
‚Ä¢ What's the #1 problem your ebook will solve for them?

2. Outline the Ebook

Plan your ebook's structure before writing.

Keep in mind:

‚Ä¢ Introduction: Describe what your ebook covers and its importance.

‚Ä¢ Main Chapters: Break your topic into smaller parts. Each chapter should focus on a different aspect of your topic.

3. Write Your Ebook

Begin writing on your topic. Keep it simple and engaging. Use images or examples to clarify your points. Writing just 300 words daily can help you finish.

4. Make Your Ebook Look Great

Your ebook's design matters. Choose a clear, simple style. Online tools can assist with design. A visually appealing ebook attracts more readers.

5. Upload to Gumroad

To sell on Gumroad, prepare:
‚Ä¢ Sales Copy
‚Ä¢ Cover Design
‚Ä¢ Thumbnail
‚Ä¢ Price

6. Share on X

Talk about your ebook on X.

Do it every day.

Non-negotiable.

7. Reach out to Buyers

Use emails to contact them.

Promote your:

‚Ä¢ Coaching
‚Ä¢ Services
‚Ä¢ Consult calls
‚Ä¢ Membership
‚Ä¢ Other offers you have

8. The Math of Ebooks:

Imagine you are selling the ebook for $20.

To make $10,000, you need to sell 500 copies.

Which is highly unlikely.

That‚Äôs why‚Ä¶

I need to stress this point:

The ebook IS NOT the main source of income here.

What happens AFTER the purchase is KEY to reaching $10K.

So here's what you need to do...

End your ebook where your other offers begin.

For example...

Photography Experts can create an ebook with beginner tips. Include a marketing section and mention your advanced marketing course or coaching.

If you're a Digital Marketing Specialist, write about basic marketing strategies for X creators and offer a free strategy session in the ebook to promote your coaching services.

Got this message yesterday:
""I‚Äôd like to close our relationship out at the end of the 1 month I paid for.""

So I cancelled the next payment right away.

I do as they please when this happens.

I've learned that trying to convince them to stay just reinforces their decision (free persuasion lesson for you there).

That said,

The story doesn't end there.

Before working with me, they had shelled out over 30,000 bucks to boost and monetize their Twitter presence.

""$30K?!?!?! On what, bro?""

On high-ticket coaching and Twitter Ghostwriters‚Äîthe plague of Money Twitter.

So my client decided to throw in the towel.

It's just not worth it for them at this moment.

You see..

They make a lot more money in their 9-5 and other endeavors, with way less hassle.

I understood where they were coming from, truly.

So, without a second thought, I put a halt on their next payment.

And also took a moment to express my sympathy for the rough ride they'd had with the previous crew.

No one likes a rocky journey, right?

Nevertheless,

It was a bit of a shock, considering we'd only been working together for 21 days.

We'd achieved so much in just those 21 days...

Way than what the previous guys had done in six months.

My client's got a lot on their plate. 

So here's what I did.

I said I was sorry they had this awful experience with the other guys.

And just told them that I'll keep working on their brand until the our agreement it over.

Oh...

And I also went into persuasion mode:

I hit the refresh button on their Twitter perspective.

I reframed Twitter for them.

Showed them how they could run Twitter in the same way they ran their other businesses.

I use their own ideas, words, and terms.

And would you believe it?

They agreed to keep working together.

So now, they're back in the game, with renewed energy. 

Best things?

They gave me the greenlight to manage their account as I please. So now I have full reins on it, making my job easier and their life way less stressful (as they won't be needing to spend time approving stuff, etc).

You know, sometimes, all it takes is to listen to your clients, to understand their reasons for wanting to let go.

If you're confident in your team's skills, like I am in mine, it's rarely your fault.

Clients come with a baggage:

Many backstabs and big promises that never came to be from service provider who lie to get clients.

So when they work with me...

It's like they can't believe what we do.

And how much money they had wasted on the other guys.

Anywho...

The key is to lend an ear, empathize, and then turn the situation around.

And that, my friend, is the art of managing clients.

üìö Step 1: Pinpoint a Problem

Start here.

Don't just write about what you know.

Ask, ""What does my audience want to learn about?""

Find their main challenge or pain.

And now you've got your ebook idea.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

üìù Step 2: Plan with an Outline

Building an ebook is like building a house:

You need a plan.

Map out your:
‚Ä¢ Chapters
‚Ä¢ Subtopics
‚Ä¢ Key ideas

This way, your writing will flow smoothly from start to finish.

But don't spend too much time here.

Instead, go to the next step.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

üñäÔ∏è Step 3: Set a Regular Writing Routine

Dodge writer's block and delays.

Pick specific times each day and stick to them.

Being disciplined means you'll finish your ebook on schedule.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

üé®Step 4: Invest in Presentation

Invest in getting a nice cover and sleek layout done.

It makes you stand out.

Sure, your content should be great.

But your ebook should also shine on the outside.

Because people do judge the ebook by its cover.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

üìà Step 5: Build the Hype Before Launch

Get your audience excited.
‚Ä¢ Share sneak peeks
‚Ä¢ Offer special early deals
‚Ä¢ Gather email sign-ups.

Building anticipation guarantees a successful launch.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

üéÅStep 6: Bundle Up

Add value to your offer.

Package your ebook with:
‚Ä¢ Related tools
‚Ä¢ Video lessons
‚Ä¢ Worksheets
‚Ä¢ Cheatsheets
‚Ä¢ Templates

Not all of them, though.

Pick the ones that make sense.

This will sweeten the deal and bump up your profit.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

ü§ñStep 7: Leverage Technology

Pick platforms that do the heavy lifting.

Whether sending emails or handling payments, make it easy for buyers.

Try out Gumroad.

It's free.

And easy to set up.

89,"The Ultimate Guide to Transitioning from Twitter/X to Instagram

X is burning to the ground.

The platform is filled with bots (again), and even the self-proclaimed ""X Growth Experts"" are looking to expand to other socials.

Why migrate?

X refuses to change course:

‚ùå¬†The retweet button is dead.
‚ùå¬†Massive accounts don‚Äôt get seen
‚ùå¬†Only politics, memes, and XXX get views
‚ùå¬†Niching down doesn‚Äôt work anymore
‚ùå You have to spend all day posting and commenting if you want actual growth (this is what the ""show your personality"" people actually do‚Äîthey'll tell you show your personality on Twitter, but that's what they are actually doing‚Äîtreating this app a full-time job.)

It‚Äôs dark outside.

And there‚Äôs nothing you can do besides posting into the abyss and hoping to grow on other channels.

So here‚Äôs your ultimate guide to migrating to Instagram:

‚Äî

1. WHY Instagram.
X posts die after a few hours.

Instagram posts get engagement nearly forever.

Many other reasons exist, but I‚Äôll let you deduce them yourself because that reason alone should make you pack your tweets and turn them into Instagram content.

‚Äî

2. What happened when I migrated to Instagram

‚òëÔ∏é I doubled my newsletter size. I've been averaging 150-200 new email subscribers daily that I can track back to Instagram.

‚òëÔ∏é I added 100 new subscribers to my paid community.

‚òëÔ∏é I've gained 30K new followers since I took IG seriously 2-3 months ago.

‚Äî

3. App you‚Äôll be useing

üí¨ManyChat for DM automation‚Äî$15/mo

üé•Capcut for creating reels‚Äîfree

üî• Meta Business Suite or Instagram to schedule your reels and posts‚Äîfree

‚Äî

4. What can you do with your Twitter/X posts?

a) Turn threads into reels
b) Turn threads into carousels
c) Turn your tweets into single-image posts

Here‚Äôs how:

‚Äî

A) Turn Threads into Reels
Instagram Reels are made up of a few key parts.

First up is the video. This is the main attraction, drawing viewers in with a catchy video.

Next, we add a text-in-video hook. This is a text overlay on the video, hinting at what the reel will reveal.

Then comes the reel caption. It adds to the video, giving extra info. Here's where you put your X thread.

For threads over 300 words, try to cut them down to 150-200 words. Why? Because reading long texts on Instagram can be tough.

Also, include a call-to-action in both the video and caption.

In the video, encourage viewers to read the caption. In the caption, tell people to comment a ‚Äúspecial word‚Äù. Those who comment will get a DM with a link to get one of your lead magnets. You can automate this process with Manychat.

‚Äî

B) Turn Threads into Carouse Reels
Carousels can have up to 10 images.

Each carousel has 2 special images. The first image has the hook, and it‚Äôs meant to grab attention. The last image is a call-to-action like asking for follows or comments to get a lead magnet.

To turn your threads into carousels, break your threads into eight clear parts for the 8 carousel images, keeping the first and last for the hook and call-to-action.

Carousel length can vary, but 6 to 10 images are typical.

Use design tools like Canva or Figma to create the carousel. I use Figma because it‚Äôs for teaming up with designers and jotting down comments during design.

‚Äî 

C) Turn your tweets into single-image posts.
First, put your tweet into an image. Include your profile photo and your handle for a personal touch. Then, write a brief caption for the Instagram post to add to the image's message.

Making single-image Instagram posts from tweets is easy.

You can do this quickly with a tool like @HypeFury, because this app lets you write a tweet and post it on Instagram with a bit more detail in the caption.

This method is fast and smooth, linking your Twitter and Instagram content nicely.

Big money steps for 2024 ‚§µÔ∏é

1: Create a Winning Guide
Start by writing an ebook that stands out.

Pick a painful problem your audience has.

Write about how to solve it.

30-40 pages is enough.

‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢

2: Price it Right

Set the price at $20+

That's cheap enough to get people to buy.

At that price, you'll only need 50 people to buy it.

But that's just the tip of the iceberg.

4: Offer More Help
Here's where the fun starts.

Gumroad has an email marketing feature.

So use it to send buyers an email to say ""Thanks!""

And then...

Do the following to increase your income.

‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢

5: Sell Your Services/Coaching

Reach out to buyers again.

Offer them your services.

You can get them to buy through emails. 

Or convince them to book a call with you.

Be clear that your help isn't free.

Tell them it'll cost $500 to $5000+.

LOOK:

All of my current clients purchased one of my guides or products before becoming clients.

The ebook is just a way to prove competence.

Ok?

‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢

6: Be a shameless self-promoter

Don't be shy about it.

The more you share, the more you'll sell.

‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢

7: Repeat the Steps

I'm telling you right now‚Ä¶

Brace yourself, because it's only going to get worse.

So, what can you do to survive this AI apocalypse?

Well, let me tell you a secret.

It‚Äôs something I tell all the new writers I onboard at Rosado Capital, my marketing firm.

I tell them:

===

Forget about copywriting. Throw content creation out the window. These jobs, these knowledge worker positions? They'll be killed out soon enough.

You need to reinvent yourself.

Don't see yourself as an executor or just a writer or copywriter. 

Instead, become a master strategist.

Someone who can see the bigger picture and identify opportunities others can't.

===

‚ÄúBut how do you do that, Jose?‚Äù

In my case, I tell my people to dive headfirst into the arts of marketing, copywriting, persuasion, and funnels.

I tell my writers this because I believe in them.

And because I know it's the truth.

You need to become a highly competent individual‚Ä¶

Someone who can navigate the AI storm, harness it, and use it to your advantage.

My operations manager, was a copywriter, and is now on the path to becoming a master strategist.

And you, too, can walk down that road.

It's up to you to make the choice.

Think about it.

The future is coming, and it's coming fast.

It's on you now, my friend.

Train yourself.

Because if you don't level up and face the AI assault head-on, you'll be left behind in the dust, with nothing but regret and ""what ifs"" to keep you company.

The AI apocalypse is coming.

I've been working on reels, designing content, managing my marketing firm, and gearing up to launch a new product.

And today, I want to share everything with you.

1. Viral Reels Creation Process
I've been having a blast creating some of those.

Even though not all got the reactions I hoped for, one is taking off.

When I was writing this, it had 33,000 views.

When I was writing it, it had 49,000 views.

And I have a feeling it'll reach 100,000 soon and then it'll go viral.

Anywho‚Ä¶

My process for creating these viral reels is simple.

1/ Download a viral sound‚Äîdoesn't matter which, tbh
2/ Find a nice video on your phone (or record one)
3/ Put the sound and the video on CapCut
4/ Edit the video

It's a crazy, simple process.

And I should've gotten into the ""viral reels"" trend sooner.

2. Free guide: Make A Fulltime Income Online
I put together a free guide that‚Äôs a surefire way to make a full-time income online selling digital products.

I first wrote it in 2019 and gave it a massive touch-up over the weekend.

I've added then link to it in the next tweet.

Here's what I cover:

‚úÖ My journey and how I turned Twitter into a 6-figure business in less than a year.

‚úÖ The detailed process to get paid for your skills in today's modern economy.

‚úÖ A proven road map to go from your regular job to becoming a full-time creator in 120 days.

It‚Äôs a treasure trove of my own personal insights, systems, and strategies for mastering the social media game to sell digital products.

3. Big News: Million Dollar Ebooks
And here's the big news:

My buddy, @AJA_Cortes, and I are rolling out a new product we‚Äôre super excited about - Million Dollar eBooks.

Know this:

It's not a pricey course.

It's an eBook, paired with a few handy videos, to get you started fast.

Picture this:

You're raking in an extra $1,000 this month, and all you did was sell eBooks.

We're putting together a streamlined system to create and market eBooks that can help you earn a stable income.

Wondering why we chose eBooks?

That's because, in my experience, eBook buyers generally attract a more intellectual lot. Not saying course buyers aren't smart, but eBook buyers exhibit a clear love for reading, which typically indicates higher intelligence.

You see...

Selling eBooks lets you connect with this clever crowd.

And with our method, making and selling them is a breeze.

Our plan uncovers every step Alexander and I took to rake in nearly $2M million selling eBooks.

Everyone swears by the $10k a month goal.

They always make it seem like wonderful things happen.

And while 10 grand a month is great, it should only be the starting point, not the main aim.

Assuming you're sitting at $10k a month right now and want to grow, here's how:

- -

1. Charge higher prices.

Most of you are too scared to charge higher because you're afraid people will say ""no.""

The truth is, they'll say 'no' because they don't trust you to make them that money back.

Increase your credibility and charge higher.

2 clients at $5k > 10 at $1k

- -

2. Make sure your services are long term

Again, most of you will collect the payment, do the work and never speak to the client again.

From the sales call to saying goodbye, it probably takes you around a week.

Make your clients commit for 6 to 12 months.

Clients love roadmaps.

- -

3. Use the $0 PDF funnel

Create a mini guide, template, or cheatsheet.

Give it away for free in exchange for emails.

Set up email sequences to give away value and then promote your service at the end.

Then, in addition to your offer upsell, send valuable emails on a regular basis.

- -

4. Never stop the outreach

The problem most people face today when trying to sell their services.

Not enough outreach.

They get 1 client and then stop trying to get more.

Don't stop.

Increase the price when you get a new client.

Keep sending DMs.

And close more deals.

- -

5. Systemize as much as you can

If you're dealing with 5 clients a month, the last thing you want to spend your time on are tasks that can be automated.

Email sequences, VA's, automatic onboarding.

Zapier is great for systems.

All your focus should be on getting results.

- -

6. Always keep your client up to date

Your clients should always believe that they have your undivided attention.

Constantly update them on what you're doing or going to do.

Show them their results

Ask them questions.

Get their input.

Always keep them up to speed.

- -

7. Constantly post your results

Nothing will make you more money than social proof.

If you're selling a service, the easiest way to get more clients is by showing them that you can get them results.

Always post your client results and testimonials.

Social proof is everything.

THREAD: The power moves for a killer digital product launch:

‚Äî

Launching a digital product can feel like a gamble, but it's more like a calculated victory with the right strategies.

Success isn't about luck‚Ä¶

It's about good planning and execution. 

And here's how Nick made it big with the strategies I shared.

‚Äî

So, what's the story behind this $298 investment? 

Nick, a go-getter but a bit lost in the digital maze, reached out for a consult call. 

He paid me 298 bucks for the call.

There, he asked for directions for his digital product launch.

I've been there, pouring money into tactics without return. 

But this time, we focused on strategies that deliver.

‚Äî

Strategy is key, and here‚Äôs what we honed in on:

1. The BIG Idea ‚Äì what's your product about?
2. Build anticipation ‚Äì create buzz before you launch.
3. Leverage scarcity ‚Äì make an offer they can't refuse.

Let's dive deeper‚Ä¶

‚Äî

1. The BIG Idea: 

Understanding YOURSELF is crucial. 

‚òëÔ∏é What's your story?
‚òëÔ∏é How can you tie your story to your product?
‚òëÔ∏é In what ways can you tie your BIG idea and story to your ideal customer's needs, desires, and pain points.

This insight is gold for crafting your message.

In Nick's case, I asked him a few questions about his journey.

And he told me about why he sold his Amazon business.

""I sold over a million dollars on Amazon, but my profit margins were 14-20%.""

There it is!

That's the big idea.

So he took that and wrote a nice, bold headline with it.

""I sold my $1M/yr Amazon Business to go ALL IN this simple business.""

Followed by a fantastic sub-headline:

""Before you think, WOW this guy's a complete idiot, let me show you the Maths behind my decision.""

Good?

‚Äî

2. Build Anticipation: 

Start teasing your audience. Use social media, email, and content marketing to stir excitement. 

A countdown or behind-the-scenes look can hype up the launch.

He did so with a Waitlist.

‚Äî

3. Leverage Scarcity: 

He limited spots to 20 buyers.

Nothing boosts sales like the fear of missing out. 

Create a limited-time offer, bonus content, or exclusive pricing for early birds.

This drives action and increases perceived value.

It took him 2 weeks to fill the spots.

So, what was the outcome for Nick?

‚Äî

He implemented the strategies, and his digital product caught fire.

In two weeks, on my advice, his $298 investment turned into $8,973 in sales.

Nick booked another call after his launch and is planning even bigger launches this year.

How?

Well, he's got the blueprint for future launches.

And guess what? 

You can replicate this success. These strategies aren't just for Nick‚Äîthey're for any business ready to launch a digital product.

That belief made me procrastinate a lot in creating my first digital product.

‚ÄúScrew that.‚Äù

And started to create my first product ever.

It was an ebook.

I named it:
Unf*ck Your Learning.

I wrote it in Spanish and then used Google Translate to get the English right.

Once finished, I designed a cover and uploaded it to Gumroad.

I still remember I was a bit scared of my venture.

I had doubts about whether it would sell or flop.

But despite that, I posted the link on Twitter.

It earned me my first $4,000 from digital products.

And I never looked back.

Since then, I've created dozens of info products.

And I‚Äôve helped my clients to create dozens of them:
- Cohorts
- Courses
- Webinars
- Newsletters
- Communities
- Masterclasses

Now, among all these formats, ebooks still rule.

There are many reasons:
‚Ä¢ You can create them easily (Again, I wrote my 1st one using Google Translate)

‚Ä¢ You don‚Äôt need any investment to build and replicate them (All the tools you need are free)

‚Ä¢ They are easy to promote and distribute (You don‚Äôt need to be tech-savvy to upload a PDF to Gumroad)

2440,"I've got a juicy little story for you.

It‚Äôs kinda gossipy.

And it‚Äôs about a student of mine who'd probably sold his kidney to buy a coaching program on how to scale his business...

Well‚Ä¶

He didn‚Äôt actually sell his kidney.

But you get the point...

So, picture this:

We've got Sean (I changed his name), right? 

He‚Äôs running a content creation agency for LinkedIn.

Anyway‚Ä¶

Sean was feeling a bit lost in his business until he stumbled upon me.

I coached him.

And hooked him up with some of that sweet biz knowledge:

‚Ä¢ How to structure his offer
‚Ä¢ Generating leads
‚Ä¢ Charging 3X his normal fees (because why the f*ck not?)

It worked like a charm. 

Sean's business went from zero to hero.

And he built himself a nice little six-figure empire. 

I felt like a proud parent at their kid's college graduation.

But then‚Ä¶

I offered Sean another coaching program‚Ä¶

With a nifty $20,000 price tag.

He turned me down because he had hired another coach‚Äîone that charged him $5,000 a month for six months. 

That's $30,000, which is like buying a brand new car.

Now...

My heart was a little shattered, not gonna lie.

*Cue the sad violin.*

But I will not fault him for wanting to toss more money at his business.

Then some time passed...

I checked up on him:

‚ÄúHow the coaching going, Sean,‚Äù I DMed him.

He confessed that the new coaching was like buying a ticket to the hype train, but it wasn't taking him anywhere. 

However‚Ä¶

He did say that spending all that cash lit a fire under his arse and made him take his business more seriously.

There are three lessons here:

1/ Don‚Äôt wait. Reach out to potential clients. 

Or, just like it happened to me, you‚Äôll lose closing a new client because someone else reached out first.

2/ Up your prices. 

Because people will pay top dollar just to kick their own ass into gear.

3/ Deliver the goods. 

Or risk being like the coach Sean wrongly hired: just one more scammer.

1/ Strategy beats passion.
My best-sellers were not the ones I loved writing.

2/ Start with what you've got.
I wrote my first ebook in Spanish and used Google Translate to get the English right, lol.

3/ Consistency beats perfection.
Regular content beats waiting for the 'perfect' ebook.

4/ Know your audience.
I wrote not for everyone but to solve specific problems.

5/ Feedback is gold.
Negative reviews teach me more than praise.

6/ Invest in good design.
A professional cover can double your sales.

7/ Price low first.
My first ebook sold for just $10‚Äîstart at $10, then raise up to $50 (yes, people will pay $50 for an ebook).

===
I first wrote an e-book on how to learn faster, which did okay. It got me my first $5K in ebook sales. Then, I wrote about growing on Twitter. This one really took off and made $42,000. I don't sell it anymore, but it was a big hit and helped me earn my first $10,000 (and more) from ebooks.
===

8/ Marketing matters.
Great ebooks don't sell themselves. Shameless self-promoting is the key.

9/ Leverage social media.
A tweet is more powerful than a traditional ad.

10/ Email lists are essential.
They were my direct line to engage readers.

11/ Authenticity sells.
Readers can tell when you're genuine. Tell your story in your ebooks.

12/ Criticism is inevitable.
Not everyone will love your work, and that's okay.

13/ Short ebooks sell.
People love quick, valuable reads. Top 50 pages.

14/ Rejection is part of the process.
Every 'no' led me closer to 'yes.'

==
I wrote an e-book about email marketing that also came with a course. I worked hard on it but made only $4,000. I hated this so much. Why did it fail? I didn't research my audience. Back then, I just thought people wanted to grow newsletters‚Äîthey didn't. But now? Newsletters are popular. Maybe if I relaunch, it will sell more? üßê
==

15/ Research
Always ask your followers about their challenges. Build a database of questions. Answer them in your ebooks.

16/ Time management is key.
Balancing writing with life meant setting strict schedules.

17/ Outsource when needed.
I have my ebooks spellchecked by 2 different people‚Äîand still‚Ä¶ some typos are never seen (See lesson #3). I bet that if I didn't do this, it would have even way more typos.

18/ Turn ebooks into courses.
The reason I do this is that I also occasionally coach people. And I've found that many coaching students prefer video courses.

19/ Celebrate small wins.
Every sale was a step towards my goal.

20/ Failure is a lesson.
Not every ebook was a hit, but each taught me something.

21/ The ebook is just the start.
Reach out to your buyers. Offer them your services. This is how I've closed most of my clients.

22/ Never give up.
Persistence is the true secret behind ebook success.

755,"Recently, I had a conversation with one of my coaching students. 

I was curious about his schedule, so I asked him to share it with me.

He opened up his Google calendar and I asked:

‚ÄúWhy do I see all of these micro blocks of 15, 20, 60 minutes?‚Äù

He explained:

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThis one is a meeting with a client.‚Äù
‚Ä¢‚ÄúThis one is time with my VA.‚Äù
‚Ä¢‚ÄúThis is my ‚Äòme time‚Äô.‚Äù
‚Ä¢‚ÄúThis is when I go to the gym,‚Äù and so on.

Curious, I asked,

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúYou have meetings in the mornings and in the afternoons. How‚Äôs that working out for you?‚Äù

He looked frustrated and confessed, ‚ÄúOh man, it's a mess.‚Äù

I dug a little deeper, 

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWhen do you feel more energized, in the mornings or in the afternoons?‚Äù

He shared that he feels more alive in the mornings. So, I proposed, 

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúAre you willing to block off all of your mornings so that you can focus on the things that makes you money?‚Äù

He agreed. 

From that moment on, he dedicated his mornings to activities that would help him monetize his brand more efficiently.

So, here‚Äôs a tip:
 
If you find yourself constantly busy, examine your calendar closely. If you can‚Äôt find two to four hours of genuine free time that you can use for money-making tasks, you need to reevaluate what you‚Äôre doing.

Reflect on this:

‚Ä¢ Are your tasks and appointments structured in a way that aligns with your energy levels and priorities? 

If not, some rearrangement could make a significant difference in your productivity and peace of mind.

Remember:

It‚Äôs not about cramming more into your day, but about organizing your time more wisely to focus on what truly matters.",12,3,10,57,29351,30,0.001942012

Most creators get this wrong.

And it's the sole reason why they can't get followers and sales.

You see‚Ä¶

I've helped many grow their businesses to 6 and even 7 figures in sales through social media, especially X and Instagram.

And this is the ONE key element that can help anyone grow and monetize their socials.

But before I tell you about it‚Ä¶

I need to talk about the process of growing & monetizing.

It's as is simple:

‚Ä¢ Ideate
‚Ä¢ Execute
‚Ä¢ Evaluate

Execution is how well you create content. And how much of a pro you are at generating leads and turning the leads into buyers.

When you evaluate what you do is take a look at your conversion rate and traffic. This is actually the easiest part because the apps you use to sell give you everything you need to make informed decisions.

So, that leaves us with step one‚ÄîIdeate.

If you mess it up, you will never win online.

So, my approach to ideating content is as follows:

- Start with the hook.

Like literally write the hooks as a way to generate ideas.

This will make you better at:

1. Writing the hooks
2. And it'll also open your third eye to detecting the viral hooks before they even go viral.

The key to writing them is‚Ä¶

All about detecting patterns.

Here are the most relevant patterns you MUST pay attention to should you want to win online:

‚Ä¢ Relevancy: What do your audience need to fix their pains and attain their desires?

‚Ä¢ Top-of-mind: Are there any trending or current events that relate to your writing that you can incorporate into your hook?

‚Ä¢ Engagement: What psychological triggers can you tap to make your hook more appealing?

‚Ä¢ Curiosity: How do you create a sense of intrigue or mystery to pique curiosity?

‚Ä¢Urgency: Can you add a sense of urgency to your hook?

‚Ä¢ Connection: Are there any memorable or personal experiences you can share that will resonate with your readers?

‚Ä¢ Entertainment: Can you use humor or wit to make your hook entertaining and leave a lasting impression?

Next‚Ä¶

Focus on giving your audience what they want and try to do it in the most entertaining way you can.

So many great pieces of content get ignored because the hook sucked.

So if you want to win online‚Ä¶

Write better hook

Today, I've pivoted. 

Now, anyone who buys a course from me is presented with opportunities, be it my coaching, services, or even other courses. Sometimes, I even suggest affiliate products that I truly believe in.

So why do many course creators skip on upselling?

I'd say it boils down to 2 main reasons: 

Fear and Laziness. 

Let's touch on fear first. 

Some think, ""What if my course isn't good enough?"", doubting their value and hesitating to offer more. Easy excuse to crush‚Ä¶ just make your course a bit better every 100 sales. Done.

Then there's Laziness. 

When you're raking in thousands every month from course sales, it's tempting to think that stream will never dry up. 

But trust me, it can and it will.

I speak from experience. 

I once rested on my laurels with over $600,000 in digital product sales, but later learned to transform those course buyers into high-value clients. 

Some of my clients even invest upwards of $80,000 on me. 

Because It's all about maximizing the relationships you build through your courses.
