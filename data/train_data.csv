Open mindedness is realizing that there are infinite -- yes infinite -- perspectives and not just yours.
People are so afraid to make a mistake that they make the biggest mistake of them all: not making mistakes.

You start with a rough idea, any idea.

Put it on paper.

Researchers have just created a brain implant that decodes thoughts into synthesized speech allowing paralyzed patients to communicate through a digital avatar.
                   
This is incredible:

-The implant converts brain signals into text at nearly 80 words per minute, focusing on phonemes vs. whole words to enhance speed.

-The AI generates realistic vocals (mirroring a patient's pre-injury voice) and facial animations that aim to enable more natural communication.

-The breakthrough brings the tech closer to real-world use, with the next step being a wireless model that doesn't require a physical connection to the interface.

Restoring communication for those with paralysis is an innovation that would change countless lives.

"What is an Alpha Male?

It may be helpful to think about masculinity by asking yourself, what is an alpha male? 

What is the hyper example of masculinity? 

And when you look at that definition, whatever it is for yourself, then you will realize what you aspire to be and how you can be your most masculine.

In my value system, an alpha male is like that gorilla who, when crossing the street with the gorilla tribe, makes sure that all the women and children and smaller gorillas get across first. He blocks the road with his body as the rest of them make the crossing.

An alpha male is an alpha male because he takes care of the tribe. In times of war and famine, he eats last. In exchange, in peacetime, he gets to eat first. But that's not the goal. The goal is he is built to do his duty. He is built to take care. He is built to be the protector. He is built to do the right thing for the largest group of people.

And he does it because it's in his nature. He doesn't do it for recompense. So you have to look deep inside your nature and find out what do you want to take care of? What is more important than yourself? What do you want to give to without any hope of return? Is it God? Is it children? Is it society? Is it family? Is it your nation? What is it that you care about more than you care about yourself? That you will defend, that you will protect, that you will uphold and that you will promote.

For example, today I would argue that people like Elon Musk, who even though they're businessmen and they make money, sure, they are trying to advance the tribe. They're trying to do what's best for the species. They're trying to get us off planet. They're trying to get us into electric cars. They're trying to get us advanced AI. And if it is done in a mostly selfless way where it's about taking care of people, then I think that is an alpha male.

And that is an expression of masculinity. It is showing that you're so strong, that your shoulders are so broad, that you can carry others with almost no effort. You can carry others as part of what you do. And the stronger you get, the more you carry.

So the best way to find your masculinity is to ask yourself, what is my duty? What am I duty-bound to do? What do I want to do to a level where it involves taking care of something outside of myself?

And it has to be genuine and it has to be heartfelt and it has to be done without hope of reward or recognition. So it cannot be something that is given to you by society. It cannot be something that is inflicted upon you by books, by your parents, by movements, or by something that's going to make you popular with the people around you. In fact, if it's a true core value, it's something that you will do even if and when it makes you unpopular with the people around you.
Good luck with everything and don't listen to other people.

As a footnote, one thing that's become popular recently is men who attract other men by showing off jewelry and cars and how many girls they have. They've gotten pretty big on social media, but those are essentially perverted, almost a caricature of feminine behaviors that they're doing to attract other women and to attract young men. But no true alpha cares what car they drive or how much jewelry they have or how many girlfriends they have, and they certainly don't use that as the way to signal their alpha. It signals exactly the opposite. It signals status-seeking, desperate, attention-seeking behavior. So don't go down that route."
The best analogy that I've found for AI is that it's like a calculator for reading and writing.

"The Unscheduled Life

Start by saying no to everything. I say no to everything. I don't have a calendar. 

When people say, how about such and such time? I say, uhmm, well, I would have to either set an alarm for it or I would have to remember it.

That way, unless I really, really badly want to do it, I just can't even do it. The maximum number of meetings I can have per day is one, because that's all I can remember or all I'm going to set an alarm for.

Second, I push everything asynchronous and unscheduled.

My mottos are, better bored than busy, and ""the overscheduled life isn't worth living.""

The world is full of opportunity. You just have to be available and have time and mental space to grab it. 

And when you grab it, you're going to be sorry you grabbed it because now there's a thousand other things you can't grab. 

So you only want to grab the ones that really, really, really appeal to you. It has to bring you out of retirement, essentially. 

But you do need something to focus on because if you don't, what are you going to do all day? You'll just drink yourself to death or do stupid things.

It does mean that you have to unschedule your entire life around you. I see many parents whose children's lives are scheduled and then they try to live an unscheduled life. It doesn't work. 

If your children have school times, nap times, play times, times when they have to eat, times when they have to go to bed, then your own life will be scheduled as well. Nothing wrong with that. Most of us don't have the luxury of being unscheduled, but if you do, your entire life around you has to be unscheduled.

It also means every single event is voluntary. You never commit to showing up and speaking at an event. You never commit to a birthday party. You never commit to a wedding. You never commit to a bar mitzvah. It means you never commit, you never let your wife commit you to anything. You never commit her to anything. 

If somebody asks, is he available for X? She doesn't even ask on their behalf. If somebody asks me, is she available for X? I don't even ask her on their behalf. So, completely free and unscheduled. It's about as hard as it sounds, but it's about ten times more rewarding than it sounds.

It means you have to break the heart of every person who expects you to be in a specific place at a specific time. That's their expectation. It's their problem, not yours.
You have to get comfortable ghosting people who become too familiar. They text you too much. They Airchat you too much. They email you too much. Just stop responding. The monkey on their back that they're trying to put on yours is not your problem. You just have to be comfortable walking away with no remorse.

When you look back on your life in that final moment, you will wish that you'd spent more time on the timeless and less time on the temporary and there are very, very few timeless things."
